1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Generally, when you think about the term intelligence, you're talking about what's the difference

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,800
between Einstein and a normal person, or between a normal person and a stupid person, but actually,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,480
it's like what's the difference between a normal person and a mouse, and what's the

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,560
difference between a mouse and a rock?

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,140
That's the difference between just levels of intelligence within humans, which actually

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,120
doesn't vary that much in the grand scheme of things, versus just what intelligence is

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,340
in general.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,420
One way of thinking about what intelligence is, is as an optimization process.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:44,060
The most basic of all optimization processes is evolution, which is looking for good replicators

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:52,060
in the search space of animals, or creatures, organisms, organisms is the word.

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:59,960
It does this by picking a point in the search space, a specific animal, and then there are

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,540
slight mutations when the thing reproduces.

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,040
It's moved slightly in the search space.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,200
Every time it reproduces, there's a slight shift because the children are not exactly

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,120
the same as the parents.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,980
The way that it evaluates the fitness function over the whole search space is how many surviving

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
children that animal goes on to have.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,920
That's what it's optimizing for.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,360
It's very slow because its movements through the search space are random, and then it just

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,400
is slightly more likely to keep movements that are upward.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,240
One way of imagining it, if you've got a two-dimensional search space, suppose we have an animal that

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,160
can actually only vary in two ways, an extremely simple type of animal.

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:52,380
At every point in this search space, there will be a fitness level, which is this abstract

24
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,420
concept of how good that organism is at reproducing.

25
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,260
On average, an organism that has these attributes is going to have how many surviving children?

26
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,340
Now we've got something three-dimensional.

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,100
You can think of it as a three-dimensional surface.

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,800
It's like some kind of mountain where there's various hills and bumps.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,720
This comes down to here, which is this, and that, and that's the top of that mountain.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,720
It's what's called a hill-climbing algorithm, and this is why I'm laying it out in this

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
particular way, because it climbs a hill.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,440
It's like a blind person, and they try just stepping in one direction at random and saying,

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,400
right, am I higher than I was?

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,200
If they're higher than they were, then they stay there, and if not, they step back and

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,440
then just try stepping randomly again.

36
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,860
Very gradually, they will climb up the mountain.

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,820
There is one problem with that, which I can show on the paper here, which is that if you

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:52,340
are a basic hill-climbing algorithm like evolution, you can climb yourself up, you know, wandering

39
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,340
around randomly.

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,540
You eventually get up to here, and once you get here, you're actually stuck because it

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,580
goes down before it goes up.

42
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,120
Even if there's a huge mountain over there, you can't see the huge mountain.

43
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,820
You only see immediately what's underneath you.

44
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,440
If you have to get less fit before you get more fit, evolution doesn't plan, right?

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,600
So it can't see that there's this huge hill off in the distance, so it gets stuck in what's

46
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,040
called a local maximum or a local minimum, which is a sort of a trap, and this happens

47
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
to evolution fairly often.

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
So that's an optimization process.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,800
Optimization processes are about finding high points on the fitness landscape, and if this

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,880
were more than two dimensions, if this were, you know, 100,000 dimensions, the more dimensions

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,180
you have, the harder it is, right?

52
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,380
Because you've got more things to change, and the whole thing just becomes much more

53
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,980
complex, and optimizing it with more dimensions is harder, and this is a big problem in machine

54
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,340
learning in general, that you end up with way too many dimensions, and you need to figure

55
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,860
out ways of just picking the dimensions that matter the most or distilling them down.

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,920
So that's what probability reduction is called, it's a whole thing in itself.

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,040
So are we saying the mountains are just how successful each point on that graph is?

58
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Yes, exactly.

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,960
So it is a third dimension, but it's not a dimension of the configuration space, because

60
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,480
each dimension is something that you can change in terms of the design of the organism or

61
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
whatever.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,440
Evolution doesn't have a direct, there's no single how many children do you have gene,

63
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
right?

64
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,900
It's an emergent property of everything else, the environment, the way that the animal ends

65
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,540
up formed from all these different genes.

66
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,160
The mountain range is just a way of visualizing it.

67
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,720
You could also look at it like a heat map, just draw it on two dimensions and shade it

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,220
so that there's like a red area around it, there's an orange area and a yellow area and

69
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,780
so on, and you're trying to sort of head towards the brightest area, something like that.

70
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,940
Just different ways of representing the same idea.

71
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:57,200
One way of characterizing what an intelligent system is, is that it's good at optimizing.

72
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,880
So evolution is not particularly good at optimizing for good replicators, but you give it long

73
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,240
enough and it does a pretty good job.

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,920
So evolution is optimizing for replication, but you can draw this type of mountain range

75
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,360
or this heat map or whatever for anything that's interesting, and an optimization algorithm

76
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,020
is trying to find the high points in that space.

77
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,460
Even if you're still only looking at your local area, you can say, well, I took a step

78
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,620
in this direction and I went up, so next time, rather than stepping completely randomly,

79
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,020
I'm going to step in the same direction again.

80
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,060
Maybe even I'm going to step a little bit further this time, because I'm assuming that

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,780
this is a good direction to head in, and if I start heading down again, then I'll start

82
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,540
looking randomly again, something like that.

83
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,600
There's always a certain cost of doing an experiment, as it were.

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,880
Evolution does all of its experiments in the real world, right?

85
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,200
It can't think.

86
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,640
Whereas if I'm designing a car or something, I can say, right, what would happen if I made

87
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,960
it six inches longer?

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,360
I can say, well, there'd be a bit more room for this, but there'd be less room for that.

89
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm thinking about it in my head.

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
I don't need to build the car.

91
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,000
And a bunch of choices that evolution would make in its random meanderings don't even

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
occur to a human.

93
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,780
You know, oh, what would happen if we just broke off one of the wing mirrors?

94
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,020
Well, you know, that immediately seems stupid, and that's the kind of thing that evolution

95
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,140
might try a few million times before it tries something else.

96
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,020
And that's one of the key differences.

97
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:29,140
A more powerful intelligence is able to hit a smaller target in a larger search space

98
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,020
in less time, which is why a car designer is so much more intelligent than evolution,

99
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,080
because a car designer can make a change, can make an improvement in an afternoon, which

100
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,480
evolution couldn't make in 100,000 years.
