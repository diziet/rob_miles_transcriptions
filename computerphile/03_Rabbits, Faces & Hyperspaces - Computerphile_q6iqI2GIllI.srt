1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
So sometimes you hear about configuration spaces, feature spaces, hyperspaces, vector spaces, whatever.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,520
What is a space?

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:20,440
Well, you will all have come across them before as, like, scatter plots or just graphs in general are a representation of a space.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,080
If you have a two-dimensional space, that just means that you have two axes on your graph.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,760
You've made a plane, right? A flat surface is two-dimensional.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,720
Here's one dimension, here's the other dimension, right?

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:43,640
Let's say we've got some animals and we want to think about those animals in a more rigorous way than just talking about them.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,560
We want to do some maths about the properties of these animals.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,240
Like, we're interested in the colour of them and their weight or something like that, their size.

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:04,000
So let's say that with some random species of animal where the females tend to be red and large and the males tend to be blue and small, for example.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,800
So you've got two axes here and you can say this one here is size and this is colour on a scale of red to blue, right?

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:22,600
So you've got, like, a zero is red, this is just a random example, and 100 is blue, and then, so, you know, 50 is, like, purple.

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,680
And then if you've got a group of these animals, you can then plot them.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,760
So suppose you've got some over here.

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:37,560
Each one of these crosses represents a single specific animal and each of these circles is also an animal.

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,560
In this case, this is a female animal, if I remember correctly.

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,640
And you can look at this and if you want a machine to do something intelligent, you want a machine to understand this, there are things that you can see.

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,640
You can see, firstly, that there's these sort of clusters.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,800
There are clustering algorithms that will automatically identify, end up sort of drawing a circle around this and saying that's one cluster and a circle around this, saying that's another cluster.

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:14,280
When Amazon is trying to tell you what kind of things it thinks that you want to buy, it may make a space of all of its users with each person being a point in that space and the dimensions being what things they've bought.

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,840
Then you'll find that the difference between you and another person, you can place a number on it.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,000
How similar are we? Have I bought the same kind of things that you've bought?

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:36,800
There are algorithms that do that or algorithms where they can sort of look at this space and sort of draw a line through it and say, OK, well, it seems like sort of anything on this side seems to be male and anything on this side seems to be female.

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,560
Even though there's overlap, even though this is fuzzy, you can make an educated guess based on these properties.

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,880
And you can do other things like take this and say, OK, of this cluster, where's the middle of it?

26
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
Where's the densest area?

27
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,920
What does a typical female size look like?

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,600
What does a typical female color look like?

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
What is a typical male color or size?

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:03,960
So if you've got your average one here and you've got your average one here, then you can draw a line between them, for example, in this space and then say, OK, then you can map everything onto this line.

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,160
And then you get a continuum between male and female.

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,360
I don't know why I chose male and female.

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,640
It's getting into, like, politics, which is not where I'm trying to go with this, but just as an example.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
So the point is various things like you can say, how typically female is this specific one?

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,440
And then you can actually measure it, right?

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,600
Before you had to just kind of guess.

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:29,280
But now you can say, well, you take the average, you take the distance to the average, you just measure what this distance is.

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,920
And that gives you an actual number that you can use.

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,000
You're taking stuff that would normally require a human intelligence.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,640
How typical is this or how male is this or whatever?

41
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,200
And you are turning it into numbers.

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,240
You're turning it into maths so that a computer can understand it.

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,120
So here, this is an example of a two-dimensional space, right?

44
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,920
But if we chose to model a third thing about the animals, I don't know, the speed that they run or something, we could have a third axis, right?

45
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,200
You could have this one coming off here being speed.

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,520
We end up with a three-dimensional graph.

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,880
And now it's very difficult because I have two-dimensional paper and I'm trying to express a three-dimensional idea on it.

48
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,920
But basically, so these end up being all spread out.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,760
Each of these dots is now somewhere along this speed axis as well.

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,480
They form a 3D sort of cloud.

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,560
So this line would become a surface, a plane.

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,400
Here you have a two-dimensional space.

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,600
To divide it in half, you need a one-dimensional object, which is a line.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,960
Here we have a three-dimensional space.

55
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,880
So to divide it up, we need a two-dimensional object.

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,080
The dividing line is always one less number of dimensions than the space.

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,840
When measuring three things about these animals, we could measure any number of things, right?

58
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,360
We could measure 150 things.

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,080
And that's fine.

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,160
The maths works exactly the same in 150 dimensions.

61
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,160
You can't draw it on a piece of paper.

62
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,640
You can't think about it in your head, but the maths is the same.

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,400
And oh yeah, we should talk about feature vectors.

64
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,760
Totally straightforward.

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,040
So when we have a two-dimensional space, you take a particular creature.

66
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,560
There we are, this red rabbit.

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,720
And we measure how much it weighs.

68
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,480
We're doing size by weight, let's say.

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,800
And we say that it weighs, you know, a gram.

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
And we say, what colour is it?

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,400
Well, it's red.

72
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,480
It's really very red.

73
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,600
So it's about zero.

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
And this, this is now a feature vector.

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,880
It's a feature vector of length two, because it's a two-dimensional space.

76
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,840
So each data point is represented by a feature vector, which is a point in the feature space.

77
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,400
So there's some fun stuff that's been done with, for example, faces, right?

78
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,920
Human faces.

79
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,560
To look at a human face and say, is that a male face or a female face?

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,480
That's the kind of thing that you would think that you really needed a human to do.

81
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,360
How would you even go about telling a computer how to do that, right?

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,880
This is the kind of challenge that these kinds of algorithms can tackle.

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,440
So it works out to be exactly the same.

84
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,960
You measure a load of things about the face.

85
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,480
You know, the distance between the eyes and the length of the nose and the width of the mouth.

86
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,440
You measure everything you can measure about the face.

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,160
And then you plot them all in a very high-dimensional space.

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,360
You tell it certain things, which one's male and which one's a female.

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,160
You find the average male and the average female.

90
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,520
And that's interesting as well, because then you can take this data.

91
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
You can take this point in space, right?

92
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,000
Each point in space represents a possible face.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,760
Everywhere in the space is a face.

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,600
It's a face space, if you will, right?

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
Is that a social network?

96
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,520
Yeah.

97
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,920
Yeah, it was a failed social network.

98
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,680
But so it's a feature space, right, of faces.

99
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,400
And then these certain points represent specific faces that you've actually loaded in

100
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,200
and said, this is a man's face, this is a woman's face, whatever.

101
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,280
So then you can find the typical male face.

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,400
But then you can do the same thing where you plot a line from the typical male to the typical female.

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,880
This line is indefinitely long, which means you can take, for example, a face

104
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,800
and you can make a face which is more male than any actual human person's face, right?

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Or more female.

106
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,880
And the mathematics of this emerges completely naturally.

107
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,320
You're just following this line along.

108
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,960
And you end up with these grotesque things.

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,600
But a certain percentage away, past the end, what you end up with is kind of cartoon caricatures.

110
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,760
So the males end up with these, like, vast, you know, big brows and big bulky jaws.

111
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,440
And the women have, like, enormous eyes.

112
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,480
They end up looking like anime characters or whatever.

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,400
Before you have this kind of concept, how do you even approach the concept of

114
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,520
how do you draw a caricature of a human being with a computer?

115
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,920
But now we can do it, right?

116
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,680
Because we have this concept of doing basically geometry in a feature space.

117
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,760
Generally, when you throw real-world data into one of these spaces,

118
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,400
it will be clustered because the real world does tend to be clustered, right?

119
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,040
It's just kind of the way that things tend to work out.

120
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,720
So people who are like me will be next to me in Amazon.

121
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,720
I'll be part of a cluster of people about my age, my gender,

122
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,840
my, you know, level of education and wealth and everything else.

123
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,480
People who tend to buy similar things.

124
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,680
And so then if somebody who's very close to me in that cluster buys something else,

125
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
then they can kind of infer that I might be likely to buy that thing as well.

126
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
That's something that Amazon does, something that, you know,

127
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Netflix does with their films.

128
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,840
All of these kind of predictive things where you just throw the data in

129
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,080
and the maths doesn't really know what it's dealing with.

130
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,520
It doesn't know that I'm a person, not an animal,

131
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
or that what I'm measuring here is, you know,

132
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,000
propensity for buying computer games instead of maths.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,160
The maths is broadly the same.

134
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,800
And so you can make computers tackle all sorts of problems

135
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
which previously they couldn't.

136
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,160
If you take a celebrity and you draw a line between average and the celebrity

137
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,800
and then continue that line,

138
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,640
somewhere out along that line is a cartoon caricature of that celebrity, right?

139
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,200
Because you've taken the ways in which their face is different

140
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,280
from the typical average face and extended it and exaggerated them.

141
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,080
And this is exactly what caricature artists do.

142
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
But now we can do it with maths.
