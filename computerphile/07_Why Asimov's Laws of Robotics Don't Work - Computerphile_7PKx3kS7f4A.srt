1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
So, should we do a video about the Three Laws of Robotics then?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Because it keeps coming up in the comments.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, so the thing is, you won't hear serious AI researchers talking about the Three Laws of Robotics

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
because they don't work, they never worked.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I think people don't see the Three Laws talked about because they're not serious.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They haven't been relevant for a very long time and they're out of a science fiction book and, you know.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, I'm going to do it.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to be clear that I'm not taking these seriously, right?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm going to talk about it anyway because it needs to be talked about.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So these are some rules that science fiction author Isaac Asimov came up with in his stories

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
as an attempted sort of solution to the problem of making sure that artificial intelligence did what we wanted it to do.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Shall we read them out then and see what they are?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh yeah, I'll look them up. Give me a second. I've looked them up.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, right, so they are...

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Law number one. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Law number two. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Law number three. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think there was a zeroth one later as well.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Law zero. A robot may not harm humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So it's weird that these keep coming up because they...

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, so firstly they were made by someone who was writing stories, right?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And they're optimised for story writing.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But they don't even work in the books, right?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you read the books, they're all about the ways that these rules go wrong.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The various negative consequences.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The most unrealistic thing about, in my opinion, about the way that Asimov did his stuff was the way that things go wrong and then get fixed, right?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Most of the time, if you have a super intelligence that is doing something you don't want it to do,

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
there's probably no hero who's going to save the day with cleverness.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Real life doesn't work that way, generally speaking, right?

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because they're written in English, how do you define these things?

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How do you define human without having to first take an ethical stand on almost every issue?

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And if human wasn't hard enough, you then have to define harm, right?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And you've got the same problem again.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Almost any definitions you give for those words, really solid, unambiguous definitions that don't rely on human intuition,

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
result in weird quirks of philosophy resulting in your AI doing something you really don't want it to do.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The thing is, in order to encode that rule, don't allow a human being to come to harm,

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
in a way that means anything close to what we intuitively understand it to mean,

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you have to encode within the words human and harm the entire field of ethics, right?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You have to solve ethics comprehensively and then use that to make your definitions.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So it doesn't solve the problem, it pushes the problem back one step into now,

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
well, how do we define these terms?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When I say the word human, you know what I mean.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And that's not because either of us have a rigorous definition of what a human is.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We've just sort of learned by general association what a human is,

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and then the word human points to that structure in your brain,

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
but it's not, I'm not really transferring the content to you.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So you can't just say human in the utility function of an AI and have it know what that means.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You have to specify, you have to come up with a definition.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And it turns out that coming up with a definition, a good definition,

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
of something like human is extremely difficult, right?

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a really hard problem of, essentially of moral philosophy.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You would think it would be semantics, but it really isn't,

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
because, okay, so we can agree that I'm a human and you're a human, that's fine,

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and that this, for example, is a table, and therefore not a human.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You know, the easy stuff, the central examples of the classes are obvious,

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
but the edge cases, the boundaries of the classes become really important,

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the areas in which we're not sure exactly what counts as a human.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, for example, people who haven't been born yet in the abstract,

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
like people who hypothetically could be born ten years in the future, do they count?

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
People who are in a persistent vegetative state, don't have any brain activity,

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
do they fully count as people?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
People who have died, or unborn fetuses, right?

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean, we, there's a huge debate, even going on as we speak, about whether they count as people.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The higher animals, you know, should we include maybe dolphins, chimpanzees, something like that?

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Do they have weight?

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And so it turns out you can't program in, you can't make your specification of humans

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
without taking an ethical stance on all of these issues.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All kinds of weird hypothetical edge cases become relevant

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
when you're talking about a very powerful machine intelligence,

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
which you otherwise wouldn't think of.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, for example, let's say we say that dead people don't count as humans.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Then you have an AI which will never attempt CPR.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This person's died, they're gone, forget about it, done, right?

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Whereas we would say, no, hang on a second, they were only, they're only dead temporarily,

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we can bring them back, right?

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay, fine, so then we'll say that people who are dead,

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
if they haven't been dead for, well, how long?

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How long do you have to be dead for?

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do we want, I mean, if you get that wrong and you just say, oh, it's fine,

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
do try to bring people back once they're dead,

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
then you may end up with a machine that's desperately trying to revive

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
everyone who's ever died in all of history

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
because they are people who count, who have moral weight.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Do we want that? I don't know, maybe.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But you've got to decide, right?

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And that's inherently your definition of human.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You have to take a stance on all kinds of moral issues

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that we don't actually know with confidence what the answer is,

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
just to program the thing in.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And then it gets even harder than that because you've got,

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
there are edge cases which don't exist right now,

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
like talking about living people, dead people, unborn people,

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that kind of thing, fine, animals,

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but there are all kinds of hypothetical things which could exist

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
which may or may not count as human.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
For example, emulated or simulated brains, right?

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If you have a very accurate scan of someone's brain

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and you run that simulation, is that a person?

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Does that count?

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And whichever way you slice that, you get interesting outcomes.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So if that counts as a person,

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
then your machine might be motivated to bring out a situation

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
in which there are no physical humans,

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
because physical humans are very difficult to provide for,

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
whereas simulated humans, you can simulate their inputs

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and have a much nicer environment for everyone.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Is that what we want? I don't know.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is it, maybe? I don't know.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't think anybody does.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But the point is, you're trying to write an AI here, right?

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're an AI developer. You didn't sign up for this.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you complain to your bank, then the strip club owner will just say,

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
he was with four girls all night and £4,000 is what that costs at our place.
