1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
In almost any situation, being given a new utility function is going to rate very low on your current utility function.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
So that's a problem.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,760
You want to, if you want to build something that you can teach, that means

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,460
you want to be able to change its utility function, and you don't want it to fight you.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,520
So this has been

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,200
formalized as this property that we want early AGI to have, called corrigibility.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,620
That is to say it's open to be corrected.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,320
It understands that it's not complete, that the utility function it's running is not the be-all and end-all.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,840
So let's say, for example, you've got you've got your AGI. It's not a super intelligence.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,800
It's just, you know, perhaps around human level intelligence, and it's in a robot in your lab.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,440
And you're testing it.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
But you

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,600
saw a YouTube video once that said that maybe this is dangerous. So you've thought, oh, okay,

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,120
well, we'll put a big red stop button next to it.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,440
This is the standard approach to safety with machines. Most robots in

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,520
industry and elsewhere will have a big red stop button on them.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,520
If it's helpful, I have a disembodied stop button.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
A large...

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,520
I happen to have a button...

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Wonderful, perfect.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Of appropriate type.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
So, we have...

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
So, right, there you go.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
Right, so...

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,520
So...

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,520
If only Hal would have been fitted with...

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Yeah.

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Sorry, Dave, I...

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Can't do that, Dave.

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Yes, you can.

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,520
Except, yeah, no, probably not.

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,520
I know that you and Frank

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,520
were planning to disconnect me.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,520
And I'm afraid that's

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,520
something I cannot allow to happen.

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Hal was an incorrigible design.

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Is this the point we're kind of making?

39
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Kind of. You've got your big stop button

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
because you want to be safe.

41
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
You understand, you know, AI is dangerous.

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
And the idea is if the AI starts to

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,520
do anything that maybe you don't want

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,520
it to do, you'll smack the button.

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,520
Make the buttons, like, mount it on its chest.

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Something like that, you know.

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,520
So you create the thing.

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,520
You set it up with a goal.

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
And it's the same basic type of machine

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
as the stamp collector, but less powerful

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,520
in the sense it has a goal, a thing that

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
it's trying to maximize, and

53
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,520
in this case, you know, it's in a little

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
robot body so that it can tootle around your lab

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
and do things.

56
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
So you want it

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
to get you a cup of tea just as a test, right?

58
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
So you set it up with this goal.

59
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
You manage to specify in the AI's ontology

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
what a cup of tea is

61
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
and that you want one to be

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
in front of you. You switch it on

63
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
and it, you know, looks around,

64
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
gathers data, and it says, oh yeah, there's a kitchen

65
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
over there. It's got a kettle and it's got tea bags

66
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
and this is, like, the easiest way for me to

67
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
fulfill this goal with the body I have

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
now and everything set up

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
is to

70
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
go over there and make a cup of tea.

71
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
So far we're doing very well, right?

72
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
So it starts driving over

73
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
but then, oh no,

74
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
you forgot, it's

75
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
bring your adorable baby to the lab

76
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
day, or something, and then

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
and there's a kid in the way.

78
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Your utility function only

79
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
cares about tea,

80
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
right? So it's not going to avoid

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
hitting the baby.

82
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
So you rush over there to hit the button

83
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
obviously, as you built it in

84
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
and what happens, of course, is that

85
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
the robot will not allow you to hit that button

86
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
because

87
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
it wants to get you a cup of tea

88
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
and if you hit the button, it won't get you any

89
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
tea, so this is a bad outcome.

90
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
So it's going to try and prevent you in any way possible

91
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
from shutting it down.

92
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Um,

93
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
that's a problem.

94
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Plausibly, it fights you off,

95
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
crushes the baby, and then

96
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
carries on and makes you a cup of tea.

97
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,520
And the fact that this button

98
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
is supposed to turn it off

99
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
is not in your utility function that you gave it.

100
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,520
So, obviously, it's going to

101
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
fight you. Okay.

102
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
That was a bad design.

103
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
Right? Assuming you're still

104
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
working on the project after the terrible accident,

105
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
you have another go at trying to improve things, right?

106
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
And rather than read any

107
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
AI safety research, what you do is just

108
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
come up with the first thing that pops into your head

109
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
and you say, okay,

110
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
let's add in some reward

111
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
for the button

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
so that

113
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
because what it's looking at right now is it says

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
button gets hit, I get zero reward,

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
button doesn't get hit,

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
if I manage to stop them,

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
then I get the cup of tea, I get, like, maximum reward.

118
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
If you give some sort of compensation

119
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
for the button being hit, maybe it won't mind

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
you hitting the button.

121
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
If you give it less reward for the button being hit

122
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
than for getting tea,

123
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
it will still fight you.

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Because it will go, well, I could get five reward

125
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
for accepting you hitting the button,

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
but I could get ten for getting the tea,

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
so I'm still going to fight you.

128
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
The button being hit has to be just as good

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
as getting the tea, so you give it the same value.

130
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Right?

131
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
So now you've got a new,

132
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
you've got a new, you know, version two.

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
You turn it on,

134
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
and what it does immediately

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
is

136
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
shut itself down.

137
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Because that's so much quicker and easier

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
than going and getting the tea,

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
and gives exactly the same reward,

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
why would it not just immediately

141
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
shut itself down?

142
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
So you've accidentally made, like, a dramatically suicidal robot.

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
We're kind of back to the

144
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
three laws of robotics again,

145
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
but could you presumably say,

146
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
well, the robot's not allowed to shut itself down

147
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
or something like this?

148
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Right, yeah.

149
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
So it's still a reward if it does,

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
so it's not going to fight you,

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
but it's not allowed to do it itself.

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
I'm guessing that's a possibility.

153
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
The robot cares about things in the real world,

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
and the button, whether it's pushed or not,

155
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
has a big effect on the things

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
that the robot cares about.

157
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Which means that the robot cares about the button.

158
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
So either it's trying to stop you

159
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
from pressing the button,

160
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
or it's trying to press the button.

161
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Either way, that's not what you want.

162
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
So suppose then you don't

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
mount the button on its chest

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
where it can hit it, right?

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
You put the button

166
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
somewhere only you can hit it.

167
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Somehow you manage to

168
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
completely isolate the

169
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
bot from the button.

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
It's a fingerprint scanner or something.

171
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Yeah, it's something that it can't do itself.

172
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Right?

173
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
It still either wants to press the button

174
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
or wants the button not to be pressed,

175
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
but now the only path is through you.

176
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
So it's now

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
incentivized to manipulate you,

178
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
to deceive you, to lie to you

179
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
in some way,

180
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
either to cause you to not press it

181
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
or to cause you to press it.

182
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
If you somehow manage to persuade it,

183
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
it's not allowed to interact with the button itself.

184
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
So in the case where

185
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
it wants the button not to be pressed,

186
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
it has a reason

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
to deceive you. So in this example,

188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
it would steer around the baby.

189
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
It would avoid the baby.

190
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Assuming it has basic level of intelligence

191
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
to know you don't

192
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
want it to hit the baby, and moreover

193
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
if you realize your mistake,

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
you will hit the button,

195
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
shut it down, and change it,

196
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
which it doesn't want.

197
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
So it will behave as though

198
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
there's a term which

199
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
I like to use here.

200
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
I'm not sure if I should just use it because it's my own,

201
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
which is that

202
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
it will Volkswagen you.

203
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
That it will

204
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
set itself up so that it

205
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
behaves properly in the testing

206
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
environment, despite the

207
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
fact that it actually

208
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
shouldn't pass the test.

209
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
You're testing it to see

210
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
if it avoids running over babies.

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
So you're

212
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
trying to see does it care about

213
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
harming humans, but actually

214
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
all it cares about is you not hitting the button.

215
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
And so

216
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
then you might end up in a situation

217
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
in which

218
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
you become convinced that

219
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
the thing is perfectly safe because it keeps

220
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
passing all of your moral puzzles and tests

221
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
that you give it, but actually it's just

222
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
has enough of an understanding of your

223
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
psychology to tell what it

224
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
thinks you've put in and what it wants.

225
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Or what you want, rather.

226
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
So it will

227
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
for as long as that

228
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
button is able to shut it down,

229
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
it will continue to attempt to deceive

230
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
you until it's in a situation in which

231
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
it believes it can't be shut down, and

232
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
then you have a problem. On the other side,

233
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
if you accidentally make something that wants

234
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
the button to be hit but is unable to,

235
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
it is going to try

236
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
and manipulate you into pressing the button.

237
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
So if you create your thing, you say

238
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
okay, make me

239
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
a cup of tea. If the button is hit,

240
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
shut yourself down.

241
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
You aren't allowed to shut yourself down.

242
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
You aren't allowed to hit the button.

243
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
But if the button is hit, the reward you get

244
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
is just as good as getting the tea,

245
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
so that you don't have a preference.

246
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
This machine really wants

247
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
to hit its own button, because that's as good as

248
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
getting the tea. So what it's likely to do,

249
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
probably, is just take a swing at you,

250
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
or something, just immediately, because

251
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
if it can quickly persuade you to hit the button,

252
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
if scaring you into hitting the button

253
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
is easier than getting the tea,

254
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
it'll just do that instead.

255
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Which is a really kind of

256
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
unexpected outcome,

257
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
that you've made this thing with perfectly reasonable

258
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
sounding rewards, and what it

259
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
does immediately is try to

260
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
terrify you.

261
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
It reminds me of the proverbial carrot and a stick.

262
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
This is almost like, this is the

263
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
stick, and actually we need to find what

264
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
the carrot is. Would that be a fair thing to say?

265
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Yeah, yeah. You want it

266
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
to actually want...

267
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
It's interesting,

268
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
because it has to

269
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
not care about whether

270
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
the button is pressed, right?

271
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Because it has to take no steps

272
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
to try and cause the button to be pressed,

273
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
and take no steps to try and prevent the button

274
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
from being pressed, but nonetheless

275
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
really care that the button

276
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
exists.

277
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
So one thing that you can do,

278
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
something slightly more sensible,

279
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
is

280
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
you define the utility function

281
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
such that the whole

282
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
part of what it's really

283
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
trying to achieve in the world,

284
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
the end of the part about

285
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
paying attention to the button being pressed and

286
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
turning itself off, and it

287
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
sets it up so that those,

288
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
it adds an adjustment term

289
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
so that those are always exactly equal.

290
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
However much

291
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
value it would get

292
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
from either it being pressed or it not being pressed,

293
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
it normalises those so that it's

294
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
always completely indifferent

295
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
to whether the button is being pressed, it just doesn't care.

296
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
So that way it will never try

297
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
and hit the button on its own, it will never

298
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
prevent you from hitting the button. That's the idea.

299
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
That's a

300
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
fairly sensible approach, it has some of

301
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
its own problems.

302
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
It sounds like a really

303
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
complicated thing to evaluate, to be honest.

304
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Yeah, firstly, yeah, it is kind of tricky

305
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
and you have to get it right, but

306
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
that's always

307
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
part of this. But one thing that's interesting

308
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
about that is that it isn't

309
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,520
what's called sub-agent stable.

310
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
So this is

311
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
something that is a desirable

312
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
property, and it's part of corrigibility in fact,

313
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
which is that

314
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
the, if there's

315
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
some property that the agent has,

316
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
you want

317
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
it to, if it makes any

318
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
new agents, that they

319
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
will have this property as well.

320
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
So you get some of that

321
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
for nothing, like, in the same way that you

322
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
don't want to take a pill that will

323
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
make you want to kill your kids,

324
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
you also don't want to make a clone of yourself

325
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
that wants to kill your kids, right? If you're making another

326
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
instance of yourself, or you're

327
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
creating some agent, you want

328
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
it to want what you want.

329
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
This is like the usual classic Disney

330
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
way out of a problem

331
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
for a baddie character where they go,

332
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I'm not allowed to do this, but that doesn't mean I can't get

333
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
this person to do this for me.

334
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
I need a young pair of legs and a strong

335
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
back to go in after it.

336
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Exactly. So in general, when

337
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
an AI designs a

338
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
successor, it will design it with the same

339
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
utility function as it has

340
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
for the same reason. But

341
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
unlike with some safety measures

342
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
where the AI will be

343
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
explicitly motivated to

344
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
remove the safety measures, if it can,

345
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
by making new agents which don't follow them,

346
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
in this case, it doesn't care.

347
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
So you might think, well, you're okay then,

348
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
it doesn't care, it won't remove the safety precautions,

349
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
but it also won't put in any effort

350
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
to keep them.

351
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
So if it's making a new version and it would

352
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
take a couple of extra seconds to put in,

353
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
oh, and also respond appropriately to the button,

354
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,520
and it could do anything else with that time

355
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
or those resources, it just won't do it.

356
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Because it looks at the utilities and says,

357
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
if the button is pressed,

358
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
I get X utility. If the button isn't pressed,

359
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I get exactly the same utility.

360
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
This bit of code does nothing, there's no point in it.

361
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
So it's going to be optimising itself,

362
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
or optimising its successor

363
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
in a way that,

364
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
yeah, it thinks is

365
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
being streamlining, potentially,

366
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
but actually it's missing the point of...

367
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
And that's kind of unavoidable.

368
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
If you give...

369
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
If you have a situation in which it wants to preserve the button

370
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
so that it can be pressed

371
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
because it wants that, then you've made something that wants

372
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
the button to be pressed and will try and manipulate you.

373
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
If you do it the other way,

374
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
you know, whichever way you do it,

375
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
you have problems. Another thing that people

376
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
have thought, you know,

377
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
as a suggestion of something you might try in this situation,

378
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
is to just have

379
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
the robot, have the AI not

380
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
know about the button.

381
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Oh, so keep it a secret. Right, you have it hidden

382
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
somewhere, you know, the machine

383
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
is being observed from somewhere else

384
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
and they have the button

385
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
and so it's outside of their control

386
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
and they don't

387
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
even know the button exists. So they're not going

388
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
to be motivated to try and deceive you because

389
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
they're not aware that you have the capacity

390
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
to shut them down and change them.

391
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
There are a few different variants on this.

392
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
But

393
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
at the core of the problem there, you've got

394
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
the fact that you're building a general

395
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
purpose machine

396
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
to learn and reason about the real

397
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
world of uncertain

398
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
abilities, I suppose.

399
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
I mean, even

400
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
very

401
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
simple optimization systems

402
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
consistently surprise people.

403
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
And so

404
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
the idea that you could reliably

405
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
keep

406
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
such a thing, a secret, indefinitely

407
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
and it would never put two and two

408
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
together. In fact, while you're

409
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
improving it

410
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
and training it, it's going to be learning about human

411
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
psychology because that's important for the final

412
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
goal. It needs to understand

413
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
humans in order to understand

414
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
what humans want in order to do what humans want.

415
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
So the idea that it's never going to think

416
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
oh, interesting

417
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,520
these guys, you know, they

418
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
don't seem to trust me, I'm aware there is

419
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
this concept of an off button

420
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
and it's weird that they haven't given me one

421
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
so maybe they have

422
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
actually and just not told me about it.

423
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
That kind of hypothesis shouldn't take

424
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
too long to occur.

425
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
And of course,

426
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
if you've designed the thing in an incorrigible way

427
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
it won't let you

428
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
know that it's figured out that you have an off button

429
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
and will just deceive you as it always had.

430
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
So that's the kind of thing

431
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
which could work

432
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
but it's not really a reliable

433
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
solution. The other thing that

434
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
people sometimes suggest

435
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
and this happens

436
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
in conversations

437
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
sometimes is that people keep

438
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
applying patches.

439
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
You have a bad idea

440
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
for a way to do this and then

441
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
somebody points out the way that would

442
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
go wrong and then rather than realise

443
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
that the core approach is flawed

444
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
you apply a patch. You say

445
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
oh, well, we'll also add a negative term

446
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
for doing that and then also

447
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
for doing that, you know.

448
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
A spaghetti code ensues.

449
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Yeah, and what's more, you're then

450
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
in a situation in which you've got this

451
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
system that you believe you've

452
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
patched every possible way.

453
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
It's kind of

454
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
you haven't

455
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
proved it's safe, you've just proved that you

456
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
can't figure out how it's dangerous

457
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
but

458
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
what are

459
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
the chances that you've genuinely thought

460
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
of every possibility?

461
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Ideally, we really want to be able to formally

462
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
prove that the system has these properties.

463
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
You don't want a system in which

464
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
you've blocked off loads

465
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
of specific actions that the AI can do

466
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
and you're just

467
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
relying on it.

468
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
It's like running a complicated search, trying

469
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
to figure out a way to screw you over

470
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
and you're pretty sure you've blocked off all the angles.

471
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
You've kind of failed

472
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
before you've begun there, that your code is

473
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
running this extensive search

474
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
that you just hope fails

475
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
and if it finds any way

476
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
to do it, it will jump on that opportunity.

477
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
It's not a good way of going about things.

478
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
The other point about this

479
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
is that the button

480
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
is

481
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
a toy problem.

482
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
It's a simplification that's useful

483
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
for thought experiments because it lets you

484
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
express your, you know, it lets you formalise

485
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
things quite well. You only have two

486
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
possible outcomes, you hit the button or you don't hit the button.

487
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
But in fact,

488
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
with Corrigibility, what we want is a more

489
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
complex range of behaviours.

490
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
We want it to actually assist

491
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
the programmers in

492
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
its own development.

493
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
If it has, you know, it has

494
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
some understanding of its own operation,

495
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
you want it to be able to

496
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
actually point out your mistakes to you

497
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
or seek out

498
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
new information, perhaps.

499
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
If you say something ambiguous, rather than

500
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
just assuming, to say, well, do you mean this

501
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
or do you mean this?

502
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
If you believe that you've been programmed poorly,

503
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
to actually draw

504
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
the programmer's attention to what may be

505
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
the mistake, rather than, like, quietly

506
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
storing that away for

507
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
any time that they might try and press this

508
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
button on you, you know. Likewise, wanting

509
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
to maintain and repair the safety systems

510
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
and so on, these are

511
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
more

512
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
complicated behaviours than just not stopping

513
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
you from pressing the button and not trying to manipulate

514
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
you into not pressing

515
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
the button. So,

516
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
there are some things that might

517
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
work as solutions for

518
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
this specific case, but you would

519
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
hope that a really good solution

520
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
to the off-button problem

521
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
would, if you run it

522
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
in a more complicated scenario, also produce

523
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
these good, more complicated behaviours

524
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
in that situation.

525
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
So that's part of why

526
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
there are some things that maybe are solutions

527
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
to this problem, but they're not.

528
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
They're only solutions to this

529
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
specific instance of the problem, rather than

530
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
the general issue we're trying to deal with.

531
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Right now,

532
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
we have a few different

533
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
proposals

534
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
for ways to

535
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
create

536
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
AGI with these properties,

537
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
but none

538
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
of them are without problems.

539
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
None of them seems to

540
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
perfectly solve

541
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
all of these properties in a way that

542
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
we can be really confident of.

543
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
So, this is

544
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
considered an open problem.

545
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
So,

546
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I kind of like

547
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
this as a place to go

548
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
from the previous thing, because

549
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
I think it gives people a feel for

550
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
where we

551
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
are,

552
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
the types of problems

553
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
that, it seems like

554
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
the simplest thing in the world, right?

555
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
You've got a robot with a button. How do you make

556
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
it not stop you from hitting

557
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
the button, but also not try and persuade

558
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
you to hit the button?

559
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
That should be

560
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
easy,

561
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
and doesn't seem like it is.

562
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
So, utility function is

563
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
what the

564
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
AI cares about.

565
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
So, the stamp collecting device,

566
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
its utility function was just how many stamps

567
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
in a year.

568
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
This is kind of like its measure, is it?

569
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Yeah, it's the thing

570
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
that it's trying to optimise.
