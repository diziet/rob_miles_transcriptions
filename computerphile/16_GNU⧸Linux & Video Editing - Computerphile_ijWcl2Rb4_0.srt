00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
November 2014. I made a video about free software and did some video editing and then people have said since would you ever go back?

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,440
to editing with free software and

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,400
I

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,440
Tried and failed miserably, but then I found that Rob is doing editing on free software. So Rob, what have you got?

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,320
Well, so I before I started my channel, I'd never edited any video at all

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,000
So I just got started with Caden live Kate is it Kate Katie and live Caden live

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,120
I don't know how to pronounce I said Caine life because this is the piece of software I used actually

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,160
right, and that's kind of why I used it because I

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,320
Hadn't heard of I hadn't gotten into open source video editing before I heard it was fairly good

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,440
It was the one you'd used so, you know, I went for that

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,400
As it were so this is a video that I just

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,560
Uploaded just recently, which is fairly typical or no, I think it's quite standard

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,600
But on the other hand, I have no idea because I have never done video editing before well from my point of view

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,480
That looks like a very sensible looking timeline. It's like using different tracks for different things

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,040
Can you show us a bit of what sort of thing you've been doing with it? Like here for example, I'm

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,880
compositing in

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,600
Some thumbnails of the other of the computer file videos because it's relevant to those

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,320
back in the day, these would have been

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,000
Annotations, you know, they would be clickable YouTube doesn't do that anymore sad times talk us through the hardware

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
Then what what have you what have you had to use to hardware is?

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,240
This

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,440
Did you make this specially I did? Yeah

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Just because I didn't have a desktop at all

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,720
I tried using my laptop this one, which is just really really not up to it on account of being

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,920
Extremely light and thin and just not made for any kind of heavy lifting

26
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,200
So I put together this machine and it's pretty

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,000
It's pretty standard here's me looking at the components that I'm putting in it

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Okay, so it's very off-the-shelf stuff, right? Yeah, pretty standard. The only thing I wanted was a lot of RAM

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,720
It's got 16 gig of RAM so that I'm not going to run out doing basic video editing and a solid-state drive

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,720
I have a 240 gig solid-state drive to do

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,040
That holds my files temporarily while I'm working on them

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,240
For performance and then a terabyte of hard disk to keep sorry two terabytes apparently

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,960
Says here two terabytes. I'm looking at the video again. One thing that I run up against is my lack of

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,720
experience with GNU Linux distros and

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,760
The irony is that that was kind of what I was testing out throughout all of this

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,840
Sure, so talk us through what you've got going there because you know a lot more about these sorts of things than I do

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Yeah, so I use

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,920
I've been through a lot of different distributions. I started off with Ubuntu

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,120
because everybody starts off with Ubuntu and then

40
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,960
What else did I try I went to crunch bang because I thought Ubuntu Ubuntu got really I think it got really heavy

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,760
Past a certain point

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,560
It was including too much stuff and being too graphical and in your face and I use Linux mint for a while because that was

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,440
very nice

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,480
What I'm using here is Manjaro, which is based on arch

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,320
But arch is a real arch is like

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,800
Look I know people get almost religious about these things. Yeah, not there's no almost about it

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,680
People people get literally unambiguously religious about these things, but you're a real console jockey

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,320
Could anybody use this kind of distro or is this kind of a I mean, I don't use that term in a derogative way

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,080
But I know, you know what you're doing with the console and yet me I need GUIs, right? Right, right

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,280
Yeah, the console is my preferred way of interacting with my computer most of the time

51
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
but

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Right, right, so I'm running Manjaro right which is arch based

53
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,400
But arch you kind of have to build from the ground up the idea of arches by the time you have a running arch

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,200
Linux installation you really

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Understand Linux because you have to you know, you've sort of it's not like you hit install and then you go off and have a

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,960
Cup of tea and come back and you're done

57
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,240
You have to actually make all of the decisions and run the commands to set up the system

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,760
So is this like you are compiling your own kernels and stuff? Not quite

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,680
But there's that kind of thing. Yeah, you're putting a lot of time into it

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,680
So you have complete control you have complete customization. Everything is exactly how you want it

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,440
but you've got to know what you're doing whereas Manjaro is

62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
arch based but

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,840
Has some sensible defaults. So somebody's done some of that work for you. Yeah, so you can still use the arch repositories and things in the arch

64
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,680
Wiki, which is amazing. Like the arch wiki is so good for all kinds of information about all kinds of software and Linux things

65
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,600
But you don't have to sit there and go through this long

66
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Installation process and all of these decisions that you're not really sure what you want, you know

67
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
so that's

68
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,240
So that's Manjaro I kind of I do like it the update thing. It's very

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,200
It's a rolling release thing so you're continuously getting updates

70
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,380
It's not like you then install the next version. It's like every day. There's a couple of updates in your system continually updates

71
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
But that does mean sometimes stuff can just break

72
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,800
because some update has broken compatibility with something with something else and you have to sit there and

73
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,160
Figure it out when you wanted to be doing work

74
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,240
That was something that got me a little bit was that I had a workflow already in place

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
So you've kind of set to work for like a flow up from scratch

76
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
How's that workflow broken sometimes because of this have you have you been kind of back to square one sometimes?

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
um, I had a problem with

78
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,080
The laptop actually where an update broke my USB microphone

79
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
it broke I

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Ended up in a weird situation where?

81
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,080
the USB

82
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,680
Audio kernel module was not present anymore because it had upgraded past itself or something

83
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,640
and

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,480
I wasn't sure it turns out it was fine, but it made me very nervous because

85
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,120
Because the the modules I had were for a different version of the kernel

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,920
so I guess the kernel had updated and that removed the old modules and

87
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,720
replaced them with the new ones

88
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,400
But I hadn't been paying attention when I was running the updates

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,040
So I didn't know if my system was actually okay, or if there was some serious problem

90
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,680
It turns out I rebooted everything was fine. It booted up with the new kernel version

91
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,840
It found the new kind of modules everything worked perfectly well, but because I wasn't sure if I'd completely destroyed my system accidentally with an update. I

92
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,600
Couldn't trust that if I rebooted it it would actually come up

93
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,640
so I

94
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,600
Made a full backup while it was running and stuff like that. Just didn't you know to be on the safe side?

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,520
But that did cost me some time obviously and anyone sensible would have had a continuous update

96
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,200
Process and it would have not cared at all if at any moment their machine exploded

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and you know always

98
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Drink enough water and get your five

99
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,680
Vegetables a day and wake up at 6 a.m. For a run, but not everybody's like that

100
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,560
I'm most comfortable doing most of my work in a terminal or a text editor

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,280
Obviously if you're doing graphics or video you need a

102
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,080
User interface a graphical user interface, but most of the time I find a terminal is more. It's more efficient. It's got a

103
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
It's got a learning curve obviously

104
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,060
But when you're good with it

105
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,520
I think you can be better and faster than doing it through a GUI most of the time and I think people who are really

106
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,520
Good with GUIs don't actually use the mouse very much, right?

107
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,560
They learn the keyboard shortcuts. And so if you're learning how to do everything in a keyboard

108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,920
Anyway, you don't really need all the little buttons. It's kind of a

109
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,480
it's like a

110
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:14,560
Is it Wittgenstein's ladder some philosophers ladder you you climb up the ladder and then you throw it away when you're done with it, right?

111
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,800
Great, but if you can climb you don't need the ladder

112
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
So

113
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,920
But yes Manjaro is usually

114
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,480
Easier to use than this because I run a tiling window manager called awesome window manager

115
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,080
Which I like because it makes efficient use of the screen space. So here you see I've got my text editor here

116
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,720
Which is sublime. I have two terminals and if I want another terminal I

117
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Open it and it opens right here

118
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,480
so

119
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,660
The number of pixels on this screen that aren't one of the programs I'm using is is almost none, right?

120
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
whereas if I put it into

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,160
Here now it's in a more sort of normal

122
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,560
Mode where I can move the the windows all like this and I can be like, oh now I'm in this this program

123
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,640
Now in that program like this is closer to the way that people usually use

124
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,760
Windering system, right, but a lot of the time I've got windows that are over the top of one another they're obscuring one another

125
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,920
I've got bits of my screen where I'm not but there's nothing

126
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
So that's how I do

127
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,760
most of my stuff and you can obviously you can adjust these like you can

128
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,760
Move them in and out and change their size relative to each other for whatever you need. Yeah, that's the window manager

129
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,520
It's called awesome and I like it a lot

130
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,680
But the point is if I were using Ubuntu with awesome window manager what you would see on the screen would be basically identical

131
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,560
Because the window manager is determining pretty much everything on the screen. So

132
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,880
The fact that I'm using my jar underneath isn't that relevant?

133
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,400
from

134
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,920
an aesthetic

135
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,680
Perspective I'm showing my complete ignorance here

136
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,760
What exactly would be different under the hood then for a completely different district, um, it's the way

137
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,120
it's the choices of software that do the

138
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,400
The system level stuff like it with something like with something like Windows

139
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,280
Everything pretty much everything it comes from Microsoft

140
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Until you get up to user space

141
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,200
like you get to choose, you know, which web browser you use but

142
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
It comes with the

143
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,720
One file Explorer and one like I don't know file system

144
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,740
Network manager like all of the bits that build the operating system

145
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,360
They come with it and they are not really

146
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,640
removable or interchangeable

147
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,520
whereas

148
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,440
Linux you have the kernel which actually doesn't do that much and then everything else that makes up the operating system is

149
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Other pieces of software the other projects made by other people

150
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,200
And you can what a distribution does is it picks a load of those?

151
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,080
That work well together and puts them all together into a distro

152
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,960
With you know sensible configuration so that they all know about one another and you know, ideally and they all work together. Well

153
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,600
But any part of that system could in principle be pulled out and replaced by a different program that does the same job

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,760
It's just like that the standard thing where you can choose

155
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,000
You can choose how you're going to you know, what your web browser is. You can choose whether you're going to use, you know

156
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Libre office or Microsoft Word. It's that but all the way down

157
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,640
Almost all the way down. I had a phase as a teenager

158
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
I think a lot of people did where I was really

159
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,520
Into it and I learned everything about how to put my system together and all the different little bits and now all of that

160
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,120
knowledge is out of date and useless because I didn't keep up with it because once I found an

161
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Operating system set up that works for me. Hey, I realized I don't care

162
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:04,320
It's interesting but there comes a point where you're using your system to work and you want to use whatever works, right? The thing is

163
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,360
This just worked. I need to emphasize that because I

164
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,560
Built this I built this PC. I put it together it booted the first time we expected it to you know

165
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,200
and then I installed Manjaro on it uneventful process I

166
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
Used, you know, I literally just went pac-man

167
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,640
Minus s Caden live enter. That's the one thing that changes the package manager like different

168
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,120
Distributions obviously use different repositories and different package managers. So you get your software from different places. They all do roughly the same thing though

169
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
anyway, I just installed Caden live and

170
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,000
It worked off the bat like I I import my videos. I import my audio. I sync them up

171
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,880
I edit them. I hit export and I use here it is. I don't export I hit render I

172
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,800
Go to this one. I just web them because that's

173
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
Normal and

174
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,440
it has all these extra options about you know, how you're gonna do the

175
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,440
You know what the exact command is and all of this stuff I

176
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,200
Ignored all of that. I hit render to file it renders. It's perfect. You upload it to YouTube

177
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,280
it knows what to do like I didn't have to

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,560
It worked out of the box, it's what I'm saying it was and so it's weird because

179
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,280
Our experiences was so different

180
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,760
And I don't know what to make of it because it's not as though I did anything brilliant, you know what I mean?

181
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,040
It's not like I did some clever thing that made it all work or I hit a bunch of difficulties that I then knew exactly

182
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,160
What to do because I'm so whatever I just it just worked for me

183
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,520
But I would also argue that people have been working on all of these bits of software and

184
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,140
Also that you know what you're doing with repositories and updating different

185
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,680
Modules and you've used a completely different operating system. Sure

186
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,720
I like it. So yeah, like I know those things like I have that knowledge some of it, but I didn't have to use it

187
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,880
I suppose what I mean by that isn't necessarily that you've been tweaking because of course you've just told us you haven't but my

188
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:18,920
My experience was that the distro that I used with the particular version of kdenlive on the particular hardware that I had

189
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,240
Did work out of the box but not in all the areas. I needed it to that's interesting and rendering out was one of the areas

190
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,800
I needed it to work

191
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,440
so so one of the things one of the one of the decisions you make when you're choosing a distro is

192
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
there's always a trade-off between

193
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,120
Being up-to-date and being stable, right?

194
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
And

195
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,600
Arch and arch based distributions generally are

196
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,640
They call them bleeding-edge, right because generally speaking you get the latest version of the software

197
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,160
So having the latest version you're probably going to have the most stable

198
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,800
You're gonna have the most bug fixes in place

199
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,440
But also the most new features that people are trying out and a lot of software projects do use a system where?

200
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They have major releases

201
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,640
Well, I used a long-term support release of Ubuntu. Exactly. Exactly

202
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:17,360
However, it was 1204 which people were telling me was out of date at the time. It wasn't the latest major release

203
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,800
Well, it was I think they I think the latest long-term release at the time was 14. Oh something

204
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,520
Okay, and I couldn't get that to work at all

205
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,960
So the long-term release didn't work now

206
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,280
I'm not going to open up the hornet's nest

207
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,560
But I will just say that I believe it to be something to do with graphics card drivers and I shall walk away at that

208
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Point. Yeah

209
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
No, I mean

210
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,240
This is the kind of thing I do. I do feel really bad for

211
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,360
People who have to deal with that like the people who work in who work on open-source software

212
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,640
Having to deal with the fact that people are gonna install

213
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,680
Graphics cards which are

214
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,360
undocumented right like the manufacturers

215
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,720
Keep as a closely guarded secret exactly how it works

216
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,840
And if they don't provide a driver or if they do that driver is just a binary blob that you can't

217
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,360
You know, you can't look inside

218
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,120
It doesn't tell you any useful information and they have to make something that works flawlessly with this tremend like GPUs are fantastically complicated

219
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,820
Will be like or how it would be implemented or whatever. The idea of this paper is that it

220
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,720
It lays out some problems that we can tackle now

221
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
which will be helpful now and

222
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,440
That I think will be helpful later on as well with more advanced AI systems and making them safe as well
