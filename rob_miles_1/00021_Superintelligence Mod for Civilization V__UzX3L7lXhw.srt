00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hi everyone. So today we're trying something a little bit different, because I read that there's recently been released a mod for the Civilization games, which includes AI as an available technology.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So they've changed the game so that you can actually produce super intelligent AI. Looks really interesting.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And this has actually come from the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Verge has a nice interview. I'll put a link to this in the description. A nice interview with Dr. Shahravin, who is the researcher who's managing the project.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And yeah, so I thought what we do for this video is have a kind of a let's play.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm new to making let's plays, and I'm actually kind of new to playing Civilization as well. I didn't play it as a kid.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So I've got a friend to come and help me with installing it and configure it and everything like that.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's Dr. Shahravin from the Center for the Study of Existential Risk.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good to be here.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That was silly, but I like it.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, so I've got Steam here. I've installed Civ V.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Which version of Civ V?

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The regular one.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Just the base game, or vanilla as we call it.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Vanilla, the vanilla one.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So how do I install this mod?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So you need to go into the Steam workshop.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Browse the workshop link.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And then, I mean, we're kind of lucky that we're quite popular at the moment.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So you can click on Super Intelligence.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's us. That's the Caesar logo.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This version is for people who have the Brave New World expansion.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But that's not what you have, so you can scroll down, and there is a link.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's the one.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll take it to the vanilla version.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
With the basic game. Okay, cool.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then you just hit subscribe.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, so let's play.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, so my understanding of this game is you start from the Stone Age or something.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You start at the prehistory, beginning of humanity type thing, and you work your way up.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So this mod presumably only actually has an effect towards the end of the game, right?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes, and we even say in the mod description that we recommend

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
if you're just trying to take a taste of the mod,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
then you should start in the latest age, just before the thing kicks in,

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which for vanilla would be in the modern era.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So we're going to show how to do that.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So you need to go into Mods.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mods.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, that's fine.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No mods installed.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And there it is.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There it is.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So it's synced from the web.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You just need to click the V.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Enable.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, that's it.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Next.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I want to be...

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who do you want to be?

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think we should be England.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We should be the UK.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who's that?

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You just passed her.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's Elizabeth.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Did I?

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, yeah, right.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Cool.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's us.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Here we are.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Game era.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You want to change that to modern.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Modern.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So future, you would have already discovered everything AI related,

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and that wouldn't be very much fun.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Gotcha.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But starting in modern is the way to do this here.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Uh-huh.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm really nervous now, because usually people, when they watch a Let's Play,

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
they want to watch someone who's, like, really good at the game win the game.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I don't know what I'm doing at all.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And I think it's going to be terrible.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And I hope people are okay with watching me fail to save the world from rogue super intelligence.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Because that's probably what's going to happen.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Right?

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This stone is also good for production, but I think at this point not as important.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Only one military unit.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Bloody hell.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, I figured that stuff out.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I figured that stuff out.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I actually have a guy here.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A city.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I'm okay.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go over and say hi.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's Almati.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They give us 30 gold.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Thanks, man.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So bad.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They gave me 30 gold.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't even, I don't even know how to pronounce the name of their city.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So these are the things that we can currently research.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yep.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And if you look a little bit into the future, you can see all of the stuff we added.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So this is a new one?

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yep.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Machine learning.

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And of course.

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We keep going.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This one over here.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Ah, the orthogonality thesis.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Nice.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Which was my last video.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So that's good.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It allows you to build the AI safety lab to reduce the chances of rogue super intelligence

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
eliminating the human race.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, that sounds great.

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So the settlers are going to establish the city here.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's Nottingham.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hey.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, I see.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We've built Nottingham and now we're unhappy.

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well.

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Social policies get us more out of more happiness from universities than we would otherwise get.

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right?

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's already embodied here.

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So universities don't usually give you a plus one happiness.

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Really?

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe they should.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, I have to do it.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have to build Nottingham University and I can build a computer file and then my own

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
channel and it's going to be great.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's Dublin.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hey.

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Dublin are militaristic, but friendly.

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't have any comment about that.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's Tyre.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
They're militaristic and irrational.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This city state as well.

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's Belgrade.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, well, okay.

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I got the other one wrong as well.

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Again, militaristic, but friendly.

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Everyone is so militaristic.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hi.

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why is he terrible?

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't know.

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've heard him called Alexander the Great.

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If it's the same guy.

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think it is the same guy.

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe this is his cousin.

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, so horses.

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I guess we don't have horses or any horses nearby any of our cities right now.

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
True.

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
True.

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Though, admittedly, we're all also in the modern era.

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So we don't really care about horses.

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They have become obsolete.

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like humans will soon become.

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right.

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah.

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I keep forgetting that.

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So what is this guy doing?

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Is he cosplaying?

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't know.

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What kind of creature are you?

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I mean, right back at you, Montezuma.

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He's got the crazy eyes.

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Also the crazy head.

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah.

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Crazy hat.

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I mean, I like his hat.

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have no criticism whatsoever about the hat.

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Montezuma the Terrible.

175
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Everybody is terrible.

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I mean, you look at his decor.

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The thing I like is that he's friendly.

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I would hate to see him when he's pissed off.

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm going to move him like around here so I can just see more.

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've discovered the Grand Mesa.

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Grand Mesa.

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yay.

183
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And now we're actually happy.

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Everybody's pleased about this big rock.

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Good.

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Wait, hang on.

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let me have a look at it.

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wow, it's a pretty big rock.

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Say hi.

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh!

191
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's America.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's taking a while to load.

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No?

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Doge Washington.

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay.

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's his earnest hope that our two people can live side-by-side in peace and prosperity.

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That sounds good.

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'd share that hope.

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah.

200
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, sugar for cotton.

201
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
One for one.

202
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Happy with that.

203
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, it gives you more happiness.

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sugar is a luxury.

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Happiness is good.

206
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We need that to put in our tea.

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We are the British.

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Perfect.

209
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
They really should make tea as a resource.

211
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's probably a mod that does that.

212
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Tea?

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You can't grow tea?

214
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No.

215
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This game is just a fraud.

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So, in order to be successful in AI in the late game, what are good things for a civilization to have?

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So, first of all, you want to make sure that there is enough safety.

218
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
AI safety research is being done.

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It requires AI safety labs, and you can only have one per city.

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, having a fair number of cities is not bad.

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ah, okay.

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That makes sense.

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Having a bunch of alliances with city-states gives you access to their AI research, which is not bad.

225
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, okay.

226
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yep, that makes sense.

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So, if there are safety researchers in Dublin and we're friends with them, we can use their safety research.

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yep.

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And their capabilities research as well.

230
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, okay.

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Of course, you want to have a good science base, so you discover all the technologies that speed up your research.

232
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, you know how citizens get made.

233
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How do citizens get made?

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I mean, are we going to get into it?

235
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, yes, but really what happens is you have lots of apples, and then your little circle gets full of apples, and then those apples turn into a citizen.

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, okay.

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And then your circle gets emptied of all the apples, and you need to start over again.

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, that's pretty much how I remember it from biology.

239
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So, we met a skier.

240
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hi, skier.

241
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Are you aware that your city is on fire?

242
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Maybe you should attend to that first.

243
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Or is this somebody else's city?

244
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I mean, they do get triple gold from pillaging cities.

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right.

246
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So, that's probably someone else's city.

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

248
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah, you don't shrink from war when necessary.

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Or fun.

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Or expedient.

251
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

252
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Again, friendly.

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Not really seeing it.

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh.

255
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And he was friendly.

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He was friendly.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You know, I said I had a bad feeling about him.

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Must be all these skulls.

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So, I get to choose between saying, you'll pay for this in time, or very well.

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Which do you think is more British?

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I mean, the second one.

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But, like, does this have any game impact?

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Not really.

264
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay.

265
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, that's nice.

266
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Definitely need to make sure that we are making some units.

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

268
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You see, that's the thing.

269
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You have a limited amount of resources.

270
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

271
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And if Montezuma shows up, then you can't spend it all on there.

272
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's sort of symbolic.

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The way that the biggest, the game that DeepMind's DQN stuff has the biggest challenge playing is Montezuma's Revenge.

274
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I haven't thought of that, but that's...

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And now Montezuma is screwing with our AI stuff.

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay, somewhat beautiful.

277
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Damn you, Montezuma.

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We will have our revenge.

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Slightly excessive force.

280
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't like how militarised this whole area has become.

281
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It has become quite militarised.

282
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, you can capture the walker.

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, they move closer.

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That was clever.

285
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, they move closer.

286
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That was really nice of them.

287
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Idiots.

288
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I wonder if the Americans are going to declare war on us.

289
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I hope not.

290
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, these guys.

291
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Can they get their guns on?

292
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, yeah.

293
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They can get their guns on.

294
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
In fact, they can kill off those.

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's hilarious.

296
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

297
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because railways are so cheap to move on.

298
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That is true.

299
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But they represent it by running extremely fast.

300
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I guess we need soldiers.

301
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, you can do bombers.

302
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, I'm going to screw up Montezuma with bombers.

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, has it really?

304
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, wow.

305
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
As long as we give him all of our stuff.

306
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's hilarious.

307
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Absolutely all of our stuff.

308
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's really an amusing offer.

309
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It is.

310
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think that's...

311
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Are you tempted?

312
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You know...

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sorry, I'm just looking at his face.

314
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think he's not making eye contact because...

315
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He looks super distracted.

316
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What's over there?

318
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What's over there?

319
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I think he just looks shifty.

320
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, I think that's like...

321
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I am bluffing.

322
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know if you know, but I am bluffing.

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Bomber?

324
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I like bombers.

325
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Hang on.

326
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Are we already building a bomber in Nottingham?

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, but you can go up to as much oil as you have.

328
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And we've got plenty of oil.

329
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah.

330
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, I like bombers too.

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They're cool.

332
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But I'm really annoyed that we have to do all of this crap,

333
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
like military stuff, instead of...

334
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It just feels wasteful, you know?

335
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Maybe.

336
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Just burning a bunch of resources on each other.

337
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean, listen.

338
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's what we do.

339
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I kind of feel a little bit bad about it,

340
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
but not really.

341
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah.

342
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Maybe he should sue for peace in a way that isn't just

343
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
give us everything you own.

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ha!

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Really?

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Really?

347
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's mean.

348
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And it's just so unnecessary.

349
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Why?

350
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay, that's not good.

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What did I do?

352
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay.

353
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, that's not good.

354
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What are you talking about, wanton aggression?

355
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What's he talking about?

356
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't know.

357
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think he just wants to do some land grab

358
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and he's making up excuses.

359
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Not that Denmarkans would ever do that in real life.

360
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, that's not a thing that happens, but...

361
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is not a thing that happens.

362
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is not a thing that happens.

363
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No, that's not a thing that happens, but...

364
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is, you know...

365
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is Washington the Terrible.

366
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He's become the terrible.

367
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He has become the terrible.

368
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He was a doge before.

369
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah.

370
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They're all so warmongery.

371
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What in the hell is going on?

372
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I mean, to be fair, when we went around,

373
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
everyone was militaristic.

374
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And that should have been a clue.

375
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't like this.

376
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay, very well.

377
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay, but he has a lot of troops around our cities.

378
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, we're really in trouble.

379
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

380
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, we are.

381
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let me just...

382
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Is anybody not at war with us?

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Us here.

384
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't even like them.

385
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I mean, are we screwed at this point?

386
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I mean, we're not going to get to AI research anytime soon,

387
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
but no one else is either.

388
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So this can just play out

389
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and then we get back on track.

390
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, okay.

391
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
All right, wartime.

392
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
All right, wartime.

393
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I mean, it is 1943.

394
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You kind of expect there to be a world war going on.

395
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But it's not a world war.

396
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's everyone at war with us.

397
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That doesn't count as a world war.

398
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is there a way to know if any of these guys are at war with each other?

399
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I think we would have known.

400
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think they are not.

401
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
London's made a bomber.

402
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Good job, London.

403
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Does that mean we have two bombers in London now?

404
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes.

405
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Nice.

406
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Why are their production so slow?

407
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know.

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
How would we find that out?

409
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Go into the city.

410
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Huh, because they've taken all of their people

411
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and stuck them in the university and in the public school.

412
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes, if you take them out of the university and the public school

413
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and back into the mines...

414
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I mean, it's war.

415
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Dig for victory.

416
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There are two sea units here and two ships.

417
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Which probably means we can just get rid of both of them.

418
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Neat.

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is a slightly confusing game to play sometimes.

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes.

421
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Okay.

422
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay.

423
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hang on.

424
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There are no more offensive units in the counter-barrier.

425
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

426
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That was well done.

427
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's hilarious.

428
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Man, naval superiority is kind of a laugh.

429
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The initial foray of Greek troops just didn't do anything.

430
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes.

431
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Luckily for us.

432
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's embarrassing, to be honest.

433
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes.

434
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Please, get wrecked.

435
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I like that it's like a Lancaster bomber.

436
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh.

437
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I've got to say, I remember the Second World War going quite differently.

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't think we were at war with the US.

439
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We were at war with the US.

440
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
On the outskirts of Nottingham, not far from Dublin.

441
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Right.

442
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh, good.

443
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Nice.

444
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay.

445
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
All right.

446
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay.

447
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm feeling less worried about this one.

448
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes.

449
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I mean, we are still at war with literally everyone we've ever met.

450
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Except Songhai.

451
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Except Songhai, for some completely unknown reason.

452
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The by far most warlike looking of all of them.

453
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Maybe except Montezuma.

454
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes, with the skulls.

455
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He maybe should realise he's the baddies.

456
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He's literally covered in skulls in front of the wall of skulls.

457
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We're sure that we're on the side of the good here.

458
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Wait, what?

459
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What?

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There are those soldiers outside of Nottingham.

461
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And a Greek destroyer found them.

462
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What?

463
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What is the Greeks doing all the way over there?

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
All right, fine.

465
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

466
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Artillery, get him.

467
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Good.

468
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's always funny when artillery just completely destroys one guy.

469
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sorry, random American soldiers.

470
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's not going to be your day.

471
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They should not have declared war.

472
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It did seem unnecessary.

473
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But we do now have a stupid amount of air power, so...

474
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Maybe people just got afraid of us?

475
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hmm.

476
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That guy's scary, let's piss him off.

477
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Okay, go over there and finish it.

478
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You cowards.

479
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And if it'll make you feel better,

480
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
a great general is going to help you out.

481
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh my God, he gets a little jeep.

482
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yep.

483
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's adorable.

484
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And a flag.

485
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And a flag.

486
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He's driving a jeep on the railway tracks.

487
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yep.

488
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He doesn't care.

489
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
He's a great general.

490
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That should teach them a lesson.

491
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah.

492
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yep.

493
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Please continue getting wrecked.

494
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Phew.

495
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah.

496
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That was a slaughter.

497
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Gentlemen.

498
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Those bombs didn't even explode.

499
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think they literally just physically hit them with bombs.

500
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's not even...

501
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's thinking about it.

502
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yep.

503
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Nice.

504
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This is still so wasteful, though.

505
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's completely consumed all of our resources for many turns.

506
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
True.

507
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And it is 9.45.

508
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's time to go around so I can make peace.

509
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh yeah.

510
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Do you think they do that deliberately?

511
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No.

512
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, Montezuma wants a peace treaty.

513
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Interesting.

514
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I accept that deal.

515
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That seems reasonable.

516
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Very reasonable.

517
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You're like random...

518
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah.

519
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Back to being friendly.

520
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What in the hell is up with Montezuma?

521
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Are you kidding me?!

522
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What weakness?!

523
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I have, like, seven bombers!

524
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You have a sword!

525
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What are you doing?!

526
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You think we should not have trusted the guy with the burning cities in the background?

527
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Maybe.

528
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Listen, Askia.

529
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If I'm honest, I've never heard of Songhai.

530
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I know this is insulting.

531
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What is...

532
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Where in the world was Songhai?

533
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I feel this...

534
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I mean, I'm revealing weaknesses in my history education.

535
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What is...

536
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Where is...

537
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Do you know?

538
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No.

539
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No.

540
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well, okay.

541
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
We'll deal with this guy.

542
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Very well.

543
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Very well.

544
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Jolly good show.

545
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
More wars.

546
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's fine.

547
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You know, we don't mind a bit of a war.

548
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And now Florence has declared war on us.

549
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We've discovered computers!

550
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Finally!

551
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
A great scientist has been born in the city of Nottingham.

552
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
How about that?

553
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What is the name of the scientist in Nottingham?

554
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Where's my scientist?

555
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Show me my scientist.

556
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Where is he?

557
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He's behind the artillery.

558
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There's scientists often are.

559
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hiding behind the artillery.

560
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
There he is.

561
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No, that's the general.

562
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Here we are.

563
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's Leibniz!

564
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Of course, okay.

565
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We've got Leibniz.

566
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He can rush a technology.

567
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Let's look at the tech tree.

568
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So we got computers.

569
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Now we can rush AI.

570
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's good.

571
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Discover technology.

572
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And then you have that golden science file.

573
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Ah, okay.

574
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Right, right, right, right.

575
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And I can just...

576
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh, wow.

577
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I could get any of these things.

578
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Any of these things.

579
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But I think AI is the most powerful.

580
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, let's do it.

581
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Alright, we're in it now.

582
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Let's win the game.

583
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The question of whether machines can think is about as relevant as the question of whether submarines can swim.

584
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay, it lets us build an AI lab.

585
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Good.

586
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So, maybe we should explain.

587
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That technology, artificial intelligence, is like...

588
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, what's the point if you have discovered artificial intelligence?

589
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So it's the field of artificial intelligence.

590
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So it's something like the Turing paper in mind, or the Dartmouth summer school.

591
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's like, hey, we have computers now.

592
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Maybe we can use them to solve this thing.

593
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe they can think, like a submarine.

594
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah.

595
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So, we've got AI.

596
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If we can also get robotics, then we can get the orthogonality thesis.

597
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah.

598
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Which is necessary if we want to build the AI safety lab.

599
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Because right now we can build the AI lab, but that's just going to cause a bad outcome without any safety research.

600
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Having discovered artificial intelligence, your researchers may now start working towards superintelligence.

601
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Manage your research through the artificial intelligence screen.

602
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You guys made a whole screen.

603
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah.

604
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Wow.

605
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You can click the thing.

606
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And it will bring up the screen.

607
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah.

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay.

609
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So our AI research level is zero, because we haven't even finished our first AI lab.

610
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
From local research, also zero.

611
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
From open research by others, also zero.

612
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And I don't know who's going to help us, because America's at war with us.

613
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The only people not at war with us are the Aztecs.

614
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah, but even people who are at war with you, if they publish, you can pick up the research.

615
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So a treaty on AI would share all research and guarantee that values of both civilizations are built into the AI being developed.

616
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I haven't signed any treaties.

617
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah, because everyone but Guantanamo is at war with me.

618
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think you said in the interview, one thing you've discovered is that if everyone's at war, AI cooperation becomes difficult.

619
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah.

620
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Maybe we should just point out that you can get to that screen both from that AI counter that has now appeared on your top.

621
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, yeah.

622
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So you can kind of quickly see that.

623
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And it's also, if you look at the kind of menus, so the little scroll icon.

624
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah.

625
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah.

626
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And then AI is at the top.

627
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Ah.

628
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Cool.

629
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay.

630
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
If you click on that thing before, then it just says AI has not been developed yet.

631
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay.

632
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So it's time to build some AI labs and some AI safety labs.

633
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Well, I mean, it's time to maybe not be at war with literally everyone.

634
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't know, man.

635
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You've done nothing to us of consequence.

636
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The worst thing you did was when that destroyer destroyed my infantry that was annoying Montezuma.

637
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Nothing else you've done.

638
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Do you remember when I steamrolled three of your units on the ocean?

639
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Never mind.

640
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Even his horse looks angry.

641
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's not the time for negotiation.

642
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
All right.

643
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
All right.

644
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I guess we're going to have to kick some ass.

645
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You will never get horses.

646
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's never going to happen.

647
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You're so mean.

648
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Well, I sued for peace, man.

649
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
He didn't want it.

650
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That is true.

651
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So London is not making that.

652
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
London's going to make an AI lab.

653
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Do you think it's realistic for there to be an AI lab in London?

654
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Well, I mean, for realism, Nottingham should have the first one.

655
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But then after that, I think there could be one in London.

656
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This is an idiot.

657
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But okay.

658
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I mean, I admire your guts.

659
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Strewn all over the jungle.

660
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh, wow.

661
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
What?

662
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
He's really tired of war.

663
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm inclined to accept.

664
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I see no reason not to.

665
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I've always wanted horses.

666
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Now we have all of them.

667
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Like Alexander.

668
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
He's bound to lose now.

669
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh, yeah.

670
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah.

671
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
For sure.

672
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah.

673
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
He's a Doge again.

674
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

675
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And technically, I'm still at war with Greece.

676
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He's just rubbish at it.

677
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah.

678
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Why do people keep declaring war on me when it works out terribly for them every time?

679
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Because you're afraid you'll win?

680
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, I should just deal with it.

681
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Uh.

682
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Another bubble.

683
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
What does our economic advisor say?

684
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
A windmill, really?

685
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We could build Green's Windmill.

686
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's in Nottingham.

687
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
There's a windmill.

688
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And it's the science windmill.

689
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's going to give us extra science.

690
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I mean, it will speed up building science buildings.

691
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So you got that.

692
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Good.

693
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We're building Green's Windmill.

694
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Okay.

695
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You seem to be very pleased with that.

696
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I am.

697
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I used to live right near it.

698
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's cool.

699
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's like a little science museum.

700
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh, I want these guys to build oil.

701
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So that we can have more battleships.

702
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
No, wait.

703
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We're technically still at war with Greece.

704
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I feel like Alexander would be deeply offended that I keep forgetting we're at war with him.

705
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Just like, oh, yeah.

706
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
We are at war with you.

707
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's just like you're not doing anything threatening.

708
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Nottingham.

709
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Build the windmill.

710
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It built the windmill.

711
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes.

712
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We have Green's Windmill.

713
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Good.

714
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Now all of our science is going to be extra sciencey.

715
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yes.

716
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Huh.

717
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Sure, you big idiot.

718
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay.

719
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The world is finally becoming slightly less belligerent.

720
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah.

721
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah.

722
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Keep bombing the sh** out of people until they stop being so damn belligerent.

723
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Okay.

724
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's...

725
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's Louis Daguerre.

726
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It is.

727
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Inventor of the...

728
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Of photography?

729
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Wasn't he?

730
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Well, clearly he should be rushing Deep Blue when the time comes.

731
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Louis Daguerre.

732
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
French artist and photographer.

733
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Recognized for his invention of the Daguerreotype process of photography.

734
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Neat.

735
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay.

736
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Father of photography.

737
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He's in Nottingham.

738
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Does it matter where Deep Blue is built?

739
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
No.

740
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Well then, Deep Blue is built in Nottingham.

741
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah.

742
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We're rewriting history.

743
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Sleeping there until you discover...

744
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Data mining.

745
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Okay.

746
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Alright, we're researching the orthogonality thesis.

747
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You know, we put all of this extra information in the civilopedia,

748
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
so if you don't know what the orthogonality thesis is,

749
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
you can actually find out about it.

750
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's a good point.

751
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If anybody didn't...

752
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Oh, what?

753
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The geeks.

754
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
They came up.

755
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Damn it.

756
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah, so if you didn't watch my most recent video about the orthogonality thesis,

757
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you could watch that.

758
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Or we can look in the...

759
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Help.

760
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
There you go, the text.

761
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Tech stuff.

762
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah.

763
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Modern era.

764
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Here we are.

765
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So this is a technology, an area of research that lets you build the AI safety lab.

766
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
To reduce the chances of rogue superintelligence eliminating the human race.

767
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And it even has this...

768
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That's pretty great.

769
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The statement of the orthogonality thesis on the bottom.

770
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Right.

771
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Intelligence and final goals are orthogonal axes along which possible agents can freely vary.

772
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
In other words, more or less any level of intelligence could in principle be combined with more or less any final goal.

773
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Okay.

774
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
How's that for a hidden message in a mod?

775
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's very subtle.

776
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah, if you think this is important, I mean, check out this guy's channel.

777
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I mean, they're watching a video on my channel, so...

778
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That is true.

779
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So we also have descriptions for artificial intelligence.

780
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah.

781
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This is really nicely done.

782
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Compliments to Shai Shapira, actually.

783
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah, he deserves credit.

784
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So you need data mining to build Deep Blue.

785
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So that's good.

786
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Let's get some of that.

787
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
How are we doing on our tech tree?

788
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We've just started on the orthogonality thesis.

789
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah.

790
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So does that mean I need de-globalization?

791
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah.

792
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh no.

793
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So you need to go all the way back to that.

794
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So I actually need ecology?

795
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah.

796
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, before that, you need penicillin and plastics.

797
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh no!

798
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, so all of that.

799
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Ah.

800
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I thought I was so close to, like, cracking the code.

801
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Not quite there yet.

802
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But it turns out...

803
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But you see?

804
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So, in fact, after AI, if you want, you can just drop orthogonality thesis and go down the other route to get capability research.

805
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
If you just trust someone else to do safety for you.

806
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So you went from AI down to robotics to orthogonality thesis.

807
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But after AI, you could have just gone back to penicillin, plastics, ecology, globalization, data mining.

808
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So you could do just AI capabilities with never bothering with safety.

809
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Right.

810
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Because you just trust that other people will handle it for you.

811
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yep.

812
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Hmm.

813
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I don't trust anyone else because literally everyone...

814
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Literally every other civ has at some time or another declared war on me for no reason.

815
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, this is not a particularly altruistic world.

816
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah.

817
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So I feel as though if I'm going to do AI right, I've got to do it myself.

818
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's going to be a made-in-Britain AI.

819
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Oh!

820
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Oh!

821
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, statistics!

822
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Maybe they'll be friends with us.

823
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Maybe.

824
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Maybe they'll declare war on us for no goddamn reason.

825
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I want to build...

826
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
In fact, I'm going to do it just because I like the idea of the Statue of Liberty being in York.

827
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So I'm actually at peace with these guys.

828
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah.

829
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's novel.

830
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
No, I'm actually at peace now with more people than I'm at war with.

831
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yep.

832
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So I feel good about that.

833
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Where is Russia anyway?

834
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't know.

835
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We haven't found them.

836
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We...

837
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Freaking...

838
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Possibly upstairs somewhere.

839
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Stealth Russia.

840
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Maybe it's over here.

841
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Nobody knows for sure.

842
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay.

843
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That means I'm really big.

844
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What is Russia?

845
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We just don't know.

846
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Okay, so Hastings needs to decide what to do.

847
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah.

848
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I think they should have an AI lab as well.

849
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Of course.

850
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Everyone should have an AI lab.

851
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah.

852
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
One for you and one for you.

853
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Everybody gets an AI lab.

854
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
No, I'll keep him guarding because the Russians could come from anywhere because we don't know where they are.

855
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Phil.

856
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So just head off that way.

857
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, okay.

858
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think we found the Russians.

859
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Ah, there it is.

860
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
There's the border.

861
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah.

862
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Okay.

863
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Well, that's good to know.

864
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That's one way to find.

865
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh.

866
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
What?

867
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You will not be able to build...

868
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Whoa.

869
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Whoa.

870
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Whoa.

871
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Ah, they were coordinating with each other.

872
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Russia and the Greeks decided to do their big attack all at once.

873
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Huh.

874
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That's cute.

875
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm really tempted to just take these horse people, though.

876
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Sure.

877
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Because I could do it in one turn with these infantry.

878
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You know what?

879
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm going to because that's going to really, really annoy him.

880
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I know he's fictional, but...

881
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We're 10% of the way towards AGI.

882
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So...

883
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
How's the risk going?

884
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So we're doing 84 of it.

885
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We're doing actually all of the AI research, aren't we?

886
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
No, it's just that of our research, it's all in-house.

887
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We're not getting from anyone else.

888
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Gotcha.

889
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because everyone's at war with us.

890
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The danger of rogue superintelligence is 98, though.

891
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah.

892
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So somebody else out there is doing AI research.

893
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yes.

894
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And it's weird that we know that.

895
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Because we don't know that, right?

896
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah, that's true.

897
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, that's true.

898
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But you kind of...

899
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's really bad springing bad conditions on players without letting them know it's happening.

900
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah.

901
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So, I mean...

902
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
In reality, we have no idea how close we are to superintelligence.

903
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Or to superintelligence risk.

904
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Having a clear number that you're aiming at is nothing like reality.

905
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But it makes a lot of sense from a game mechanic design.

906
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah.

907
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So in general, in the mod, you kind of have to go either realistic, this is important to us to capture height.

908
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Or if we do it this way, it's not going to be fun to play.

909
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Right.

910
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, that's the same thing, I think.

911
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
People, they ask like, okay, so when is it going to happen?

912
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
How long is it going to take?

913
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Where are we?

914
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Right?

915
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Everybody wants to believe that we actually know how far away we are.

916
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's unknown unknowns, right?

917
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah.

918
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
If we knew exactly what the problems were that we needed to solve, and how long it would take to solve them,

919
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
we would already be most of the way to solving them.

920
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That is true.

921
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I mean, look at the record of humanity.

922
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
We're not very good at forecasting technology progress.

923
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's true.

924
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Particularly for things that are brand new.

925
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah.

926
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Look at development of nuclear weapons.

927
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You had some people kind of actively working on it.

928
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Other people saying it's never going to happen.

929
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah.

930
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Applications of electricity.

931
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I mean, go back as far as you want to really transformative technologies.

932
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's kind of, if you have a rough idea of how it's going to work, then you have some timeline in your head.

933
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But a lot of it depends on things that you don't know until you're going to try them.

934
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And if you don't have a timeline in your head, then you just have some vague arguments about why it's never going to happen.

935
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah.

936
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That's often the distribution of predictions that you have.

937
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But here, in the land of fiction and games, we know that we're 10% of the way there.

938
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah.

939
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But...

940
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
But the risk is outpacing our own progress.

941
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Right.

942
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Which would make sense if a lot of people are working on it.

943
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So to clarify the rules here, if this hits 800 before this hits 800...

944
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Everyone dies.

945
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We're screwed.

946
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Okay.

947
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
If we're trying to get AI...

948
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Right.

949
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And specifically AI safety, what are the things we're going to need?

950
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So you're going to need AI safety labs.

951
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Right.

952
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Which you can build once you discover Oroginality's thesis.

953
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Okay.

954
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Which I think is not very far in the future.

955
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So what I'm going to want once I actually have AI labs, once I have AI safety labs, is research capability.

956
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Right?

957
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So is there anything I can build now that will increase my research capability?

958
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So in terms of research, you've maxed out on currently available tech.

959
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You have the university and the public school.

960
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yep.

961
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And you haven't discovered the thing that lets you build research labs yet.

962
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Right.

963
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But you will also want to have lots of populations, so you can have excess population to put as AI specialists.

964
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So I want happiness.

965
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So that's both happiness and food.

966
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Right.

967
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So aqueduct and stadium are both relevant to that?

968
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah.

969
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And you would want to have money, so you could put it into treaties and the safety fund.

970
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Gotcha.

971
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Alright, well I'll go with the aqueduct then because it's super quick.

972
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Sure.

973
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Nice.

974
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Hey!

975
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
We've researched the orthogonality thesis!

976
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The greatest task before civilization at present is to make machines what they ought to be.

977
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The slaves instead of the masters of men.

978
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Wow, when was that written?

979
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I should go and look it up.

980
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Also, I'm not sure we want slaves, but we definitely don't want them to be masters either.

981
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, I was thinking that.

982
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Like, slaves feels very anthropomorphic.

983
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I envision well-aligned AGI as just wanting the things that we want so that we don't need to enslave it or control it.

984
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's free to do what it wants, and what it wants to do is good things.

985
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah.

986
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I kind of really like the minds in the culture novels.

987
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh yeah?

988
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
If we get it right, this is what it might look like.

989
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We have this kind of other that wants what we want.

990
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So these are novels by...

991
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Ian M. Banks.

992
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Right, Ian M. Banks.

993
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
They're officially recommended novels, there you go.

994
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yeah, yeah, I agree though.

995
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The culture seems to have a good...

996
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's not perfect, but it's sort of a plausible good outcome.

997
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes.

998
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I mean, as with anything.

999
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This is beyond the pale of transformative technology.

1000
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
We don't know what the outcome is going to look like.

1001
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But it's nice to have some positive visions that don't involve slaves or masters.

1002
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Right.

1003
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I agree.

1004
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So, we can build AI safety labs.

1005
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
This is exciting times.

1006
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
We're now at 102 AI and 118.

1007
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Which probably means it's not an AI lab in a city-state.

1008
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's just minor accidents.

1009
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So we have made it so that whenever there is AI research...

1010
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Right.

1011
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You occasionally get some chance of extra risk being generated by any of the labs.

1012
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Oh, okay.

1013
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's kind of...

1014
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Someone forgot to run the set of tests before committing the code.

1015
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
What would be an example of the kind of thing you're thinking of?

1016
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So, say there is a software bug in a common AI framework.

1017
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Okay.

1018
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Right?

1019
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yep.

1020
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It goes in there.

1021
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It goes undetected.

1022
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Many years down the line, either a human adversary decides to exploit that vulnerability...

1023
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Mm-hmm.

1024
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Or a system that's under an optimization pressure finds a way of exploiting that vulnerability.

1025
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Mm-hmm.

1026
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So it's just a little bit more risk built into your system.

1027
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Because you haven't designed anything in advance to be as safe and secure as possible.

1028
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Right.

1029
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
So things like terminating strings with nulls at the end, other than having the length at the beginning...

1030
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Opens up a whole category of buffer overflows.

1031
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Right.

1032
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It in itself doesn't cause any harm.

1033
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But it just increases the risk of something bad happening further down the line.

1034
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So in the real world, then, we probably have a huge amount of that.

1035
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Because most people writing most software, including AI software, are not making an extraordinary effort to make sure that their code is very secure and robust.

1036
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes.

1037
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
There is a paper whose name of which I'm not currently remembering.

1038
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I think it had demons in it.

1039
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
This one.

1040
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm just making editing work for myself now.

1041
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm not going to do that.

1042
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Okay.

1043
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah.

1044
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But they survey security vulnerabilities in common AI frameworks.

1045
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And they find a whole bunch of them.

1046
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Interesting.

1047
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Okay.

1048
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's cool.

1049
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I will link to that paper if I remember to.

1050
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I guess just more bombardment.

1051
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
That's fine.

1052
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And I'm going to use it to screw over these horses.

1053
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Because that's my number one priority.

1054
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Surely the people trying to capture the horses.

1055
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Right.

1056
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
No, I love horses.

1057
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I love horses.

1058
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
As a true Englishman, I'm a friend to all animals.

1059
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
In the AI screen, you can get to either by clicking on the AI progress bar or phone bell.

1060
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You can now access the AI safety fund.

1061
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Ah.

1062
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So there are no AI safety labs in the world.

1063
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
True.

1064
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I can invest in a city state to establish an AI safety lab.

1065
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Do I have the money?

1066
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I do not have the money.

1067
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You don't have the money.

1068
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
These are quite expensive.

1069
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah, okay.

1070
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Huh.

1071
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
There's no point in this conflict continuing any further.

1072
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Except he wants quite a bit of your money.

1073
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
He wants all of my money.

1074
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Okay, how about we just, you know...

1075
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
No?

1076
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
No.

1077
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Alright, I mean, I've got a lot of bombers that I don't feel like selling and not enough Russians to attack, so I'm fine with that.

1078
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
York has finished its safety lab.

1079
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah.

1080
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Okay.

1081
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Okay, let's go into the city.

1082
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah.

1083
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Okay.

1084
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So you see how all of these specialist buildings...

1085
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yep.

1086
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
...have spots next to them?

1087
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Mm-hmm.

1088
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So you can manually assign people to work in them.

1089
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Ah, so right now we have a guy in the factory and that's it.

1090
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
An engineer in the factory, yeah, and nothing else.

1091
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Everyone else is out in the fields producing stuff.

1092
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Gotcha.

1093
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Now, both the AI lab and the AI safety lab have three specialist slots that are currently empty.

1094
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So right now we are still ahead on rogue points.

1095
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah.

1096
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So I want to do more safety and less regular research.

1097
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Right.

1098
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So I'm going to... Does the fact that this is an engineer, is that more powerful than just putting a dude in there?

1099
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Like he's orange instead of green or whatever?

1100
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So green people walk the tiles in the land.

1101
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Mm-hmm.

1102
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So that person, for example, is generating five food and two gold.

1103
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Right. He's a fisherman.

1104
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yes.

1105
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And he's a fisherman in a place that actually has fish, unlike this guy who's a fisherman in a place that doesn't have any fish.

1106
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Dude, stop being a fisherman.

1107
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Instead, come with me and be a fisher of AI.

1108
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Now he's unemployed.

1109
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah. You can just click the... You don't need to do it again. You just click the thing. Yeah.

1110
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Ah, nice.

1111
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Cool.

1112
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah.

1113
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Interesting.

1114
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
A bunch of silver and gold.

1115
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm okay with that.

1116
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I guess she's completely fed up with being at war, right?

1117
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah. Also, she has no more units on our borders to bomb.

1118
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah. Yeah, we really did just destroy everything.

1119
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
If you had any units, I would say let's make war with Greece.

1120
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You know, to just finish them off, too.

1121
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But that's fine. I accept.

1122
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yeah. You're welcome, you idiot.

1123
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, actually, I should talk to Greece before we get into this.

1124
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Hmm.

1125
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it is. Yeah.

1126
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
A peace treaty.

1127
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Hey!

1128
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Do we want anything else from them?

1129
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
A research pact?

1130
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
They don't have the money.

1131
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah, because you've been spending it all on units that I immediately destroy.

1132
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
No, he doesn't want it.

1133
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
What do you want? What do you want to end it?

1134
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yes.

1135
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Alright.

1136
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm going to bomb the hell out of Sparta, then.

1137
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I mean, I don't see that you've really left me much choice.

1138
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It's funny, the prerequisites for the orthogonality thesis,

1139
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
because you would think it would be,

1140
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
all you need is to just think about it a little bit.

1141
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Hmm.

1142
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Did we just destroy their jets?

1143
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah, we did.

1144
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Nice.

1145
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So, nowadays, thinking about the orthogonality thesis is a bit hard

1146
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
without having thought about AI as a thing yet.

1147
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Hmm.

1148
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And also having AI as a thing, but not having thought about robotics very much.

1149
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I guess instrumental goals are more salient

1150
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
when you have these systems that are actually meant to be in environments

1151
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
and doing various things.

1152
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Sure. Yeah, that makes sense.

1153
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I guess it's kind of interesting, like,

1154
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
it's very hard to know which ideas are obvious,

1155
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
because there are so many things that seem obvious in retrospect.

1156
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You know?

1157
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I shouldn't be bombing this guy.

1158
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I should be taking these horse people are the absolute priority.

1159
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
What am I doing?

1160
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You can just do that.

1161
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah.

1162
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So, imagine, like, early days of AI.

1163
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The idea was that you were just going to hard-code everything.

1164
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
With such a system, safety concerns are not obvious.

1165
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Sure, the system only does what you tell it to do.

1166
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And that is still kind of received wisdom about AI.

1167
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah.

1168
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But once you start thinking with robotics,

1169
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
you realize that something like reinforcement learning

1170
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
is going to be a lot more salient.

1171
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Now, machine learning is only going to come up much later in the tech tree.

1172
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But I think the earliest is when you start mixing the idea

1173
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
of having computers think for themselves

1174
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and realizing that this is going to be much harder

1175
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
than just coding everything by hand.

1176
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Right.

1177
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That actually there's a level of unpredictability there.

1178
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah.

1179
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Which people didn't realize early on.

1180
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I think the maximum of how things are easy and easy things are hard

1181
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
came from people who were very much working on robotics.

1182
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Right.

1183
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yeah, that's really true.

1184
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The things that seem easy to human beings

1185
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
are the things that we've been doing for so long

1186
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
that we're kind of running in specialized hardware.

1187
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah.

1188
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
They're easy because we don't have to think about it

1189
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
because they're things that we're highly optimized to do.

1190
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah.

1191
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And that includes some of our morality.

1192
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Right?

1193
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We just know that something will make us super embarrassed

1194
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
or just feel really guilty.

1195
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Right, yeah.

1196
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I guess that is like low-level support for morality.

1197
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's instinctive.

1198
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah.

1199
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And so it feels super obvious.

1200
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
But it's not going to be easy, obvious to code this into an AI.

1201
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
This thing that was put in place by a tremendously long process of evolution

1202
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
doing game theory

1203
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
with all of these specialized ad hoc twists and turns and details.

1204
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Funny that we're sitting here chatting about morality

1205
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
as you're bombing the outskirts of Sparta.

1206
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
They're not people, though.

1207
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You're correct.

1208
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
They're simulations of people.

1209
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And they have been mean to you.

1210
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
They've been mean to me.

1211
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And they refuse to make peace.

1212
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yes.

1213
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And they are like...

1214
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Not only are they simulations of people,

1215
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
but they're like...

1216
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
They're not accurate simulations of people either, you know?

1217
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
True.

1218
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
They're not high detail enough to have moral weight.

1219
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I just want to look at him again.

1220
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Hi.

1221
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Hi.

1222
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
He's calling you his friend.

1223
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah.

1224
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
That's his friend's face.

1225
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah.

1226
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So...

1227
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So you're going to cities on his side?

1228
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Oh, right.

1229
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, cities.

1230
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And then pick Dublin.

1231
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Dublin.

1232
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
What do you want for Dublin?

1233
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
No, you don't.

1234
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
No, you're really, really into Dublin.

1235
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah.

1236
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Okay, the Aztecs, way into Dublin.

1237
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
That's fair.

1238
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Dublin's nice.

1239
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I mean, it's a nice place.

1240
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It is a nice place.

1241
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Okay, um...

1242
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Best Guinness I've ever tasted.

1243
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah, yeah, because it's fresh.

1244
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah, it actually tastes different, though.

1245
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah.

1246
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Ah.

1247
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Pfft.

1248
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I mean, I could.

1249
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Are there any horses?

1250
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
No.

1251
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No.

1252
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I'll leave them.

1253
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'll leave them.

1254
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So kind.

1255
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I don't like killing civilians for no reason.

1256
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So...

1257
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Um...

1258
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I feel civilians don't like being killed for no reason.

1259
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Get out of the temple.

1260
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
What are you doing?

1261
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Get in the lab.

1262
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So what did we have?

1263
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Two in the factory, two in the university.

1264
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That seems sensible.

1265
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah.

1266
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And you had one in the windmill.

1267
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Is that Green's windmill?

1268
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
How are we doing with the numbers?

1269
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah, yeah, that's Green's windmill.

1270
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
We need somebody in there.

1271
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh, you've caught up.

1272
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yes.

1273
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
We may actually win this.

1274
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yeah.

1275
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I feel good about it.

1276
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It does seem like no one else is in the race,

1277
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
which makes it a lot easier to win.

1278
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Yeah.

1279
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I feel terrible.

1280
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It's not...

1281
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The thing is, it's not Sparta's fault

1282
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that Alexander is an idiot.

1283
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I'm just going to sue for peace one more time.

1284
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Fair.

1285
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
He keeps saying that.

1286
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But he's not standing behind his...

1287
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Ah!

1288
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Ah!

1289
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Finally!

1290
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Thank you.

1291
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
How long have we been at war with Greece?

1292
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I think since...

1293
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Since the 40s?

1294
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's been 30 years.

1295
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's a 30-year war.

1296
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Make peace.

1297
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah.

1298
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You can do this with all the city-states now.

1299
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm at war with Florence,

1300
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
who I'm pretty sure I've never seen,

1301
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
but fine.

1302
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah.

1303
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Let's make peace.

1304
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah, cool.

1305
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Thanks, man.

1306
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And Kathmandu.

1307
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Yeah.

1308
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Hey!

1309
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And Stockholm.

1310
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Wait, what?

1311
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Oh, they're at war as well.

1312
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Ha!

1313
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yeah.

1314
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Did I just make world peace?

1315
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Yeah.

1316
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I think I just made world peace.

1317
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It was surprisingly easy.

1318
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I don't really understand the AI safety fund mechanic.

1319
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So it's just getting another safety lab.

1320
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Right.

1321
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So say you're going for a challenge

1322
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and you only have one city.

1323
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That means you can only have one safety lab,

1324
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
which means at most you have

1325
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
about six safety per turn.

1326
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I see.

1327
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Which is clearly not enough

1328
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
to balance the world's needs,

1329
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
but you can use this fund

1330
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
to establish safety labs all over the world.

1331
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I see.

1332
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So if you're low on cities

1333
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
but cash-rich,

1334
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
you can establish safety labs somewhere else.

1335
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah.

1336
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And we've finished researching...

1337
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Ecology.

1338
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So we can get globalization.

1339
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah.

1340
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's good.

1341
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And then that lets us get data mining.

1342
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Okay.

1343
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Which almost makes sense.

1344
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh, and now that you've built universities

1345
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
in all your cities,

1346
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
you can build Oxford University.

1347
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Interesting.

1348
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
If we had more budget,

1349
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I would have just changed its name to Cambridge.

1350
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But...

1351
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Gazitvlax is like Oxford,

1352
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and, I mean, I'm a fan as well.

1353
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Not quite as good as Cambridge,

1354
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
but not that bad either.

1355
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

1356
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I...

1357
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm not going to say bad things about Oxford.

1358
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But, um...

1359
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I prefer Cambridge too.

1360
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Uh, but I...

1361
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
In the absence of Cambridge,

1362
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I think it's a good idea to build this.

1363
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Because it gives plus three science...

1364
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And a free technology.

1365
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And a free technology.

1366
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And we really could use both of those.

1367
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
My AI researchers have reached

1368
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
the level of advanced AI.

1369
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
The new AI manufacturing technique

1370
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
will give you a 20% increase

1371
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
to production in all cities.

1372
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Well, that's great.

1373
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm really on track to win this one then.

1374
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yep.

1375
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Thank you all.

1376
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
How's Blisk?

1377
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah, our AI research level

1378
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
is higher than our rogue.

1379
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, and no one seems to be

1380
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
going off the air.

1381
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What are satellites?

1382
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Reveal the entire map.

1383
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
That sounds great.

1384
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay, so you can...

1385
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I'll get rocketry.

1386
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Okay.

1387
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Okay.

1388
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Cool.

1389
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
A good rule for rocket experimenters

1390
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
to follow is this.

1391
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Always assume that it will explode.

1392
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That also applies to AI.

1393
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It really does.

1394
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Yeah.

1395
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Oh, you could build the Apollo program.

1396
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Well, yeah.

1397
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
You can't.

1398
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Because we removed all of that

1399
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
from the game.

1400
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Okay.

1401
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But that gets you a science victory.

1402
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yeah.

1403
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So, basically,

1404
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
we took the original science victory

1405
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
from the game,

1406
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
which is you build the Apollo program,

1407
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
you build a spaceship,

1408
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
you launch it to Alpha Centauri,

1409
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and instead we said,

1410
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
you win a science victory

1411
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
if you build an

1412
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
aligned superintelligence.

1413
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Oh, so you would notice

1414
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
that you can now build

1415
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
a smart defense grid?

1416
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Improves the defense of the city.

1417
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Must have advanced AI to build.

1418
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Increases risk of rogue superintelligence

1419
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
by one per turn.

1420
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Ah.

1421
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So if we were still at war

1422
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
and we started trying to use

1423
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
our AI stuff in a military way,

1424
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
that would give us a big advantage,

1425
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
but also increase risk.

1426
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah.

1427
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
So usually the defense buildings,

1428
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
you kind of need to build them

1429
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
one after the other.

1430
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So you build walls,

1431
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and then you build the thing

1432
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
that comes after walls.

1433
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I think it's a military base

1434
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
or something like that.

1435
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
They kind of stack up,

1436
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
but walls give you

1437
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
plus four defense.

1438
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Right.

1439
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Smart defense grid says,

1440
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
forget all of that.

1441
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You can just automate your defenses.

1442
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You get plus 15 to your defense,

1443
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
which is quite a lot.

1444
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Right.

1445
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But A, you can't build it

1446
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
until you've reached this threshold,

1447
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and B, it does come with some risk.

1448
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Right.

1449
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Because you've got a whole bunch

1450
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
of military type stuff

1451
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
being software controlled,

1452
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and you're also researching

1453
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
more military type stuff.

1454
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yep.

1455
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
That makes sense.

1456
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Oh, he has wine.

1457
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Hey, and he has excess wine.

1458
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah.

1459
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Maybe he wants cotton for it.

1460
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah, you want some,

1461
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
you want some,

1462
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
where's my cotton?

1463
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You want some cotton?

1464
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yay!

1465
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Good.

1466
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Well done.

1467
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And everybody's happy

1468
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
because we have wine.

1469
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Again, once more,

1470
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Britain has wine.

1471
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
How about this year?

1472
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And there was much rejoicing.

1473
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
That's a lot of Aztec troops.

1474
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Where are they?

1475
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I mean,

1476
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
they're not technologically advanced.

1477
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm curious about

1478
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
what the Aztecs are up to.

1479
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Where am I?

1480
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Where am I?

1481
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
They're invading Greece.

1482
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
They're in Greece's land.

1483
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Maybe they have

1484
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
open borders with them though.

1485
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Ah.

1486
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We have data mining.

1487
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
That allows us to build Deep Blue.

1488
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That sounds good.

1489
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Yeah.

1490
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I guess we're just being okay

1491
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
with Canterbury being

1492
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
surrounded by Aztecs.

1493
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I mean, we have a lot of bombers.

1494
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Hastings has finished

1495
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
their research lab.

1496
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Yeah.

1497
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Oh, I could build

1498
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
a military AI lab.

1499
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah.

1500
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
That gives you 30 experience

1501
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
for all units.

1502
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You must have advanced AI

1503
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
to build it.

1504
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It increases risk

1505
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
of rogue super intelligence

1506
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
by two per turn.

1507
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yeah.

1508
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So this is even worse

1509
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
than a smart defense grid

1510
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
because now we're talking

1511
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
about offensive capabilities.

1512
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah.

1513
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So this is the same.

1514
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
There is the kind of barracks

1515
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
that leads to the armory

1516
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
that leads to the military academy

1517
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
that gives you

1518
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
extra experience.

1519
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So you know how

1520
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
all of the units we created

1521
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
got one improved,

1522
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
one upgrade

1523
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
as we created them?

1524
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Yep.

1525
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
It's because we started

1526
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
in the modern age.

1527
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So you have a barracks

1528
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
in all of your cities?

1529
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Right.

1530
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Plus 30 means that you will get

1531
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
two upgrades

1532
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
just as you create them.

1533
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah.

1534
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So this is like,

1535
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I feel like there's all kinds

1536
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
of game mechanics here

1537
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
that we're just not using

1538
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
by virtue of being too good.

1539
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yeah.

1540
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
We've played too well

1541
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and there are problems

1542
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
that we're just not even facing

1543
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
like how to balance

1544
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
the necessary military benefit

1545
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
that we need to survive.

1546
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
With AI risk.

1547
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Versus world AI risk.

1548
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Hmm.

1549
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I'm very uncomfortable

1550
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
about this.

1551
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Hey!

1552
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
The game of chess

1553
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
is not merely an idle amusement.

1554
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Several very valuable qualities

1555
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
of the mind

1556
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
useful in the course

1557
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
of life are to be acquired

1558
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and strengthened by it

1559
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
so as to become habits

1560
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
ready on all occasions.

1561
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
For life is a kind of chess.

1562
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Thanks, Benjamin Franklin.

1563
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Hmm.

1564
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
He's on my underwear.

1565
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Actually, I'm wearing

1566
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Benjamin Franklin underwear.

1567
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It's true.

1568
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
That's good to know.

1569
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Yeah.

1570
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It's a hundred dollar bill

1571
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
underwear, but...

1572
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Hmm.

1573
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Okay.

1574
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So this now means that

1575
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
artists provide

1576
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
plus one AI research.

1577
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't have any artists.

1578
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Do I?

1579
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
No.

1580
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You have other people

1581
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
you put in temples

1582
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
and museums.

1583
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Ah.

1584
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I took somebody out of the temple

1585
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
actually, didn't I?

1586
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Okay.

1587
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Now we can build a data center.

1588
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Yep.

1589
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's the future.

1590
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It became the future.

1591
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yep.

1592
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Jonathan Colton was right.

1593
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Okay.

1594
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So...

1595
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
So the idea with Deep Blue

1596
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
is that it captures

1597
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
society's mind

1598
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
so it's not just

1599
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
AI researchers

1600
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that are now able

1601
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
to contribute

1602
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
to this technological progress.

1603
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Ah.

1604
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Lots of other people

1605
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
suddenly become

1606
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
part of it.

1607
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Right.

1608
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It becomes

1609
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
more of an

1610
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
interdisciplinary

1611
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
thing.

1612
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yes.

1613
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Almost a social movement,

1614
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
if you like.

1615
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And in the midst of all of this

1616
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
all hell apparently

1617
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
is breaking loose.

1618
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Does it involve us?

1619
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I feel like it's gonna.

1620
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Huh.

1621
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
You were right.

1622
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Hey, he has changed

1623
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
his facial expression.

1624
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah, he looks a lot...

1625
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
He looks about the same angry.

1626
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It's just a bit different.

1627
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
He looks like a different

1628
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
kind of angry now.

1629
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
He looks a bit...

1630
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I don't know.

1631
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
He looks like he just

1632
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
spilled his pint.

1633
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Yeah.

1634
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That's exactly what he looks like.

1635
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Very well,

1636
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you big moron.

1637
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And there is an

1638
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
unprotected general

1639
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
outside London

1640
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
that the tank

1641
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
can just steam all over.

1642
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
He never was very bright,

1643
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
was he, Montezuma?

1644
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I spent all this time

1645
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
building missile cruisers

1646
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and tanks and things

1647
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
and didn't get to use them

1648
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and now I get to use them.

1649
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Bombers,

1650
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
awaken.

1651
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I feel bad

1652
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
for the Aztecs, man.

1653
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I feel embarrassed

1654
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
on their behalf.

1655
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Agbar was

1656
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Bonnie Nottingham.

1657
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Cool.

1658
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm gonna assume

1659
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
that he's the

1660
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Star Wars guy,

1661
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
the fish one.

1662
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Mm-hmm.

1663
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I'm gonna assume

1664
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
that he's the

1665
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Star Wars guy,

1666
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
the fish one.

1667
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Combat with bombers

1668
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
is, like,

1669
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
very effective

1670
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
but not actually that fun.

1671
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Oh.

1672
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Okay.

1673
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Piss off, Montezuma.

1674
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I don't-

1675
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I don't-

1676
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I don't understand

1677
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Montezuma at all.

1678
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
How much is this war

1679
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
gonna have to cost him

1680
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
before he realises

1681
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
it's stupid?

1682
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Cool.

1683
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Aztecs are just

1684
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
moving around

1685
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
but not sending any jets.

1686
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I guess they don't

1687
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
have vision.

1688
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah.

1689
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And they're not gonna

1690
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
get vision either

1691
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
because I'm gonna

1692
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
blow the crap out of

1693
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
everything before

1694
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
it gets close.

1695
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yeah.

1696
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm annoyed.

1697
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I'm annoyed because

1698
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm trying to do

1699
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
a nice thing here.

1700
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I'm spending a lot

1701
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
of resources

1702
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
on AI safety research.

1703
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I'm trying to

1704
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
create utopia

1705
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and this guy

1706
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
who still has

1707
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
a skull for a hat

1708
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
is coming at me

1709
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
with-

1710
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I think it's just

1711
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
feathers on his hat.

1712
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
World War II.

1713
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
He's got a golden

1714
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
skull on it, man.

1715
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Look.

1716
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Yes.

1717
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yes.

1718
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
That is very much

1719
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
a golden skull.

1720
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Right?

1721
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah.

1722
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What would it take-

1723
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
No.

1724
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
No.

1725
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Okay.

1726
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Just very, very determined

1727
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
to be stupid

1728
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
and hurt himself.

1729
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So I feel like

1730
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
AI safety wise

1731
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
this has been

1732
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
relatively uneventful.

1733
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Yeah.

1734
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Because

1735
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
No one else

1736
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
has gone for it yet.

1737
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Nobody else is going

1738
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
for that

1739
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
going for that

1740
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
win condition.

1741
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
How are we doing?

1742
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
We're still

1743
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
more than double.

1744
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Yeah.

1745
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So we actually

1746
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
can be quite safe

1747
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
to just

1748
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
max out our AI labs.

1749
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah, I guess

1750
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
in this scenario

1751
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
it turns out

1752
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that alignment

1753
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
is not so hard.

1754
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I guess

1755
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
OpenAI were wrong

1756
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
all the time

1757
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and Miri were-

1758
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, I mean

1759
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I guess

1760
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
if you have-

1761
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Well, if you have

1762
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
full control

1763
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
of the project.

1764
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yeah.

1765
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
There's only one person

1766
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
and you haven't really

1767
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
kind of started racing

1768
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
until you've discovered

1769
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
what the nullity thesis is

1770
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and you've put a bunch of people

1771
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
on the problem

1772
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
to begin with.

1773
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Yeah.

1774
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
They could just come up

1775
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
with a sensible solution.

1776
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That would be nice,

1777
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
wouldn't it?

1778
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It'd be lovely.

1779
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Yeah.

1780
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I don't think

1781
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
it's the world we're in.

1782
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
But

1783
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
counterfactually

1784
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
there are worlds like that.

1785
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I've got atomic theory.

1786
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yeah.

1787
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Cool.

1788
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Don't need it.

1789
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Your AI researchers

1790
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
have reached the level

1791
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
of expert AI.

1792
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
The new AI-driven abundance

1793
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
increases happiness

1794
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
in each city by two.

1795
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Great.

1796
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That's good.

1797
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Wow, we're doing really well

1798
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and it's just strange

1799
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
that we're at war

1800
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
with a crazy-

1801
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
What is that?

1802
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Oh, it's uranium.

1803
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah.

1804
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
It just became uranium.

1805
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah.

1806
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
We never cared about it before

1807
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
so we didn't notice

1808
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
that the ground was glowing.

1809
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
That's exactly right.

1810
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Okay.

1811
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
You know,

1812
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
you only see things

1813
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
once you know

1814
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
that they are there.

1815
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1816
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I do feel bad

1817
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
attacking Dublin, though.

1818
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
You're liberating it.

1819
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Oh, right,

1820
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
liberating Dublin, yeah.

1821
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
We're going to liberate

1822
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
this s**t out of Dublin.

1823
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Bam!

1824
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Sorry, Dublin.

1825
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You'll thank us

1826
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
in the future

1827
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
when you're no longer

1828
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
a puppet

1829
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
of ridiculous

1830
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
golden skull hat man.

1831
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I feel bad, though.

1832
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I don't-

1833
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So sad.

1834
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It's such a sadness.

1835
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Your move, Montezuma.

1836
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It's just been nuked.

1837
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It must be so pissed.

1838
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Yeah.

1839
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Ah!

1840
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Fine.

1841
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm going to

1842
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
go and get

1843
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
some water.

1844
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I'm going to get

1845
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
some water.

1846
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm going to get

1847
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
some water.

1848
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I'm going to get

1849
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
some water.

1850
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm going to get

1851
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
some water.

1852
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I'm going to get

1853
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
some water.

1854
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm going to get

1855
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
some water.

1856
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Fine.

1857
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Idiot.

1858
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I can't get over

1859
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
how dumb he is.

1860
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Your AI research

1861
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
is one that the risk

1862
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
of rogue superintelligence

1863
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
is becoming higher.

1864
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Consider dedicating

1865
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
more resources

1866
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
to AI safety

1867
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
to prevent catastrophe.

1868
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But that's

1869
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
because we got 250.

1870
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Okay,

1871
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
we're still about W.

1872
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I'm comfortable

1873
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
with that.

1874
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
602 now.

1875
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
We are steadily advancing.

1876
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We are extremely happy.

1877
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Wow.

1878
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Nuclear fission,

1879
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
fine.

1880
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm more about fusion

1881
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
personally.

1882
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It is fusion.

1883
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Oh, it is fusion.

1884
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Yay!

1885
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I read fission.

1886
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Yeah, you have.

1887
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You've had fission

1888
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
for like

1889
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
two years now.

1890
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Okay.

1891
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Good.

1892
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
You're discovering these things

1893
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
one a year now.

1894
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That's pretty crazy.

1895
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
We're a heavily

1896
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
research-oriented civilization.

1897
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That is true.

1898
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
This is Britain.

1899
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
We care about two things.

1900
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
AI research

1901
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
and bombers.

1902
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And those horse guys.

1903
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So you're making

1904
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
so much AI research now.

1905
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
It might just be

1906
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Oh my goodness.

1907
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Have a look.

1908
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah, do it.

1909
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
What's happening

1910
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
on AI reform?

1911
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Yeah, no one else

1912
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
has even gone down the path.

1913
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Nobody else even cares at all.

1914
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Okay.

1915
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Fine.

1916
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Ah, well,

1917
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
so it turns out

1918
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
that's how you avoid

1919
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
an AI race.

1920
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Yes,

1921
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
you have no one

1922
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
pursuing it

1923
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
other than you.

1924
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah.

1925
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Perfect.

1926
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Just make sure

1927
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
everyone's incredibly militaristic.

1928
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I can start

1929
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
researching future tech.

1930
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah.

1931
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
You're done.

1932
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Research tree.

1933
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Not much left

1934
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
for the AI to do for you.

1935
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah.

1936
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah, I guess

1937
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
you just became

1938
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
a tech

1939
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
speed down

1940
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
the tech tree.

1941
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Use that

1942
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
to gain

1943
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
further advantage

1944
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
of going down

1945
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
the tech tree.

1946
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Yeah.

1947
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Everyone else

1948
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
decided to go militaristic

1949
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and it backfired

1950
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
because we had superiority.

1951
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Yeah.

1952
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
So,

1953
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
good.

1954
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Wouldn't be so easy.

1955
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Oh.

1956
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Because it passed 500,

1957
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
is that?

1958
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Yeah.

1959
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But we're nearly there.

1960
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
We are nearly there.

1961
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Isn't it weird

1962
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
that

1963
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
putting people

1964
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
in the opera house

1965
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
is better for AI research

1966
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
than putting them

1967
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
in the university?

1968
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I mean,

1969
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
have you seen the kind of research

1970
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
that gets done in universities?

1971
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
No comment.

1972
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Oh,

1973
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
coming in with tanks now.

1974
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Yeah.

1975
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Easy peasy.

1976
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Anyway,

1977
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
no concern of ours.

1978
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
No,

1979
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
we're just,

1980
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
like,

1981
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
double-checking our code.

1982
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah!

1983
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Well done.

1984
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
You have achieved victory

1985
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
through mastery of science.

1986
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
You have conquered

1987
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
the mysteries of nature

1988
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
and ushered in a technology

1989
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
that makes utopia

1990
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
within reach.

1991
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Your triumph

1992
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
will be remembered

1993
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
as long as the stars

1994
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
burn in the night sky.

1995
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Hurrah!

1996
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Everything is wonderful

1997
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and the sun never sets

1998
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
on an artificial intelligence-powered

1999
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
British Empire.

2000
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Everything

2001
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
is wonderful.

2002
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Everything

2003
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
is beautiful.

2004
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Nothing hurts

2005
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and all's for the best

2006
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
in this best-of-all-possible world.

2007
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
This video took a lot more

2008
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
editing work

2009
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
than my usual videos,

2010
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
in part because it's

2011
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
a lot longer

2012
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and also because I started

2013
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
with about nine hours

2014
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
of gameplay footage.

2015
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I had to get some new equipment

2016
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
to make it all work,

2017
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
so I want to thank

2018
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
my excellent

2019
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Patreon supporters,

2020
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
all of these people here,

2021
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
for making it possible.

2022
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
In this video,

2023
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I'm especially thanking Steve.

2024
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Thank you, Steve.

2025
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I hope you enjoy the little

2026
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
behind-the-scenes video

2027
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I made about

2028
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
how this one was put together,

2029
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and I've also uploaded

2030
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
the full, like,

2031
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
eight-hour-long version

2032
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
if you want to watch that.

2033
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Anyway, thank you again,

2034
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
