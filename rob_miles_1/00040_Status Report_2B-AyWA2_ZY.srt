Hi, welcome back. Sorry for the delay in uploading, instead of our regularly scheduled video,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,080
today we're going to have a quick comparison between this, my laptop, and this, a paper

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,320
A4 notebook. Which one's lighter? They feel about the same. Call that a draw. Which one's

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,160
thinner? About the same. Which one's better at editing videos that are more than a few

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:41,720
minutes long? Hang on, let me check. Yeah, neither of them can do that. At all. I had

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,720
the first video all shot and worked out, and I've been trying to edit it for a long time

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,920
now, but it's just not going to work. The laptop is not powerful enough. So, long story

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,400
short, I'm building a PC. Parts are on the way. I'm going to delete this video obviously

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,120
when I get the actual one up, but just have patience, and I'll see you again soon.

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:25,240
Quiet on set!
