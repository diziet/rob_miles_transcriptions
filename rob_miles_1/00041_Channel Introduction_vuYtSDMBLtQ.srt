Hi, my name's Rob Miles, welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,680
It seems pretty likely that sooner or later we'll develop general artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,700
That is to say, a software system that's able to reason about the world in general and take

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,020
actions in the world at large.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,700
We don't know how to do that yet, but before we figure it out, it would be good to know

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,580
for sure that any such system we create would be safe, would be positive, would be beneficial

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,140
to humanity.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,700
It's not as easy as it sounds.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,460
On this channel, we'll talk about machine learning and artificial intelligence.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,300
We'll look at some of the problems of AI safety and some of the work being done right now

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,060
on those problems.

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,260
And more importantly, if you know anyone who you think might be interested in this kind

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,740
of thing, send them a link.

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,860
Yeah, that's it for now.

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,860
New videos coming soon.

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,860
Watch this space.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,460
Ah.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,460
Perfect.

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,460
Perfect.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,460
Yeah.

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,460
That's the take.

25
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,460
Use that one.
