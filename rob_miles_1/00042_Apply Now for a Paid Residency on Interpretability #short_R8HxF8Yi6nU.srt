00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Modern language models can write poems, explain jokes, and convince people that they're

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,360
sentient. But we have almost no idea how they work. Like, what are they doing internally?

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,120
If that bothers you, you might want to apply to Remix, a neural network interpretability

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,280
residency run by Redwood Research. If accepted, you'll build on recent progress in interpretability

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,120
research to reverse-engineer the mechanisms that models use to generate language. This

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,320
is a small and new field, so it's very possible that you could uncover something important

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,480
and surprising. The paid research program takes place in Berkeley, California in December

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,880
or January, depending on your availability. If you're interested, look up Redwood Research

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,480
Remix and apply right now, because the deadline is November 13th.
