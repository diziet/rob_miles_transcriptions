1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Say you've got a huge diamond you want to protect.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,000
So you put it in a cool sci-fi vault

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,740
with all sorts of sensors and actuators.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,440
You have an AI system to run the vault,

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,480
and the plans it comes up with

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,560
might be too complex for you to understand,

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,080
but it also predicts the final view from the camera

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,480
after the plan happens.

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,900
So before you okay a plan,

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,560
you can check that the diamond is still there at the end.

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,760
But imagine a plan that allows a thief to come in

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,480
and set up a screen in front of the camera

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,780
showing a diamond.

14
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,120
The predicted outcome looks good,

15
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,640
so you okay the plan and the diamond is stolen.

16
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,020
But this should be avoidable, right?

17
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,900
In order to predict the right fake image,

18
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,380
the AI has to know that the diamond's been stolen.

19
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,340
But how do you get that information out?

20
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,980
Solving this problem in its hardest form

21
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,500
is extremely difficult.

22
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,540
So difficult, in fact,

23
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,900
that the Alignment Research Center

24
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,320
is offering prizes of five to $50,000 for good ideas.

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,700
So if you think you've got a solution

26
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,180
based on the description I've just given, you don't.

27
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,380
Read the full technical report.

28
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,660
It's 105 pages of reasons why your idea won't work.

29
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,260
But if you've carefully gone through all of that

30
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,500
and still think you've got something,

31
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,780
send it in, link below.

32
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,500
The deadline is February 15th.

33
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,940
I think I'll have a go myself.
