1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,600
When I was a boy, our Nintendo Was cut from an old apple tree

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,600
And we used garden hose to connect it To our steam-powered Comma TV

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
But it still beat that ancient Atari

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Cos I damn near went blind, don't you know?

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Playing Breakout and Pop on a video game Hooked up to the radio

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,600
And we walked seven miles in a schoolhouse

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Barefoot and a hill both ways

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Through blizzards in summer and winter

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Back in the good old days

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Back when Fortran was not even 3-tran

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,600
And a PC was only a toy

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
We did our computing by gaslight

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,600
When I was a boy

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
When I was a boy on that twilight sea

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,600
People hauling in fish from the sea

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Our board range was 8 bits an hour

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,600
And our IP address was 3

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,600
And you kids who complain that your mobile network's too slow

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Ought to cut out your bitchin'

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Cos when I was a boy, every packet

21
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Was delivered by carrier pigeon

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,600
And we walked 15 miles in a schoolhouse

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Barefoot and a hill both ways

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Through blizzards in summer and winter

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Back in the good old days

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Back when Fortran was not even 2-tran

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
And the mainframe was only a toy

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
And we did our computing by torchlight

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,600
When I was a boy

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
When I was a boy, our I.S. showed

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
The relational tables were weird

32
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
And we wrapped our data in oilcloth

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Preserving the best that we could

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
And we carried our bits in a bucket

35
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
And our mainframe weighed 900 tonnes

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,600
And we programmed in 1s and in 0s

37
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
And sometimes we ran out of 1s

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,600
And we walked 30 miles to the schoolhouse

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Barefoot and a hill both ways

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Through blizzards in summer and winter

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Back in the good old days

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Back when Fortran was not even 1-tran

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
And the abacus only a toy

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,600
And we did our computing in primordial darkness

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,600
When I was a boy

46
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
When I was a boy
