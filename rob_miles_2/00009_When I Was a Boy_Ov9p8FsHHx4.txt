When I was a boy, our Nintendo Was cut from an old apple tree And we used garden hose to connect it To our steam-powered Comma TV But it still beat that ancient Atari Cos I damn near went blind, don't you know? Playing Breakout and Pop on a video game Hooked up to the radio And we walked seven miles in a schoolhouse Barefoot and a hill both ways Through blizzards in summer and winter Back in the good old days Back when Fortran was not even 3-tran And a PC was only a toy We did our computing by gaslight When I was a boy When I was a boy on that twilight sea People hauling in fish from the sea Our board range was 8 bits an hour And our IP address was 3 And you kids who complain that your mobile network's too slow Ought to cut out your bitchin' Cos when I was a boy, every packet Was delivered by carrier pigeon And we walked 15 miles in a schoolhouse Barefoot and a hill both ways Through blizzards in summer and winter Back in the good old days Back when Fortran was not even 2-tran And the mainframe was only a toy And we did our computing by torchlight When I was a boy When I was a boy, our I.S. showed The relational tables were weird And we wrapped our data in oilcloth Preserving the best that we could And we carried our bits in a bucket And our mainframe weighed 900 tonnes And we programmed in 1s and in 0s And sometimes we ran out of 1s And we walked 30 miles to the schoolhouse Barefoot and a hill both ways Through blizzards in summer and winter Back in the good old days Back when Fortran was not even 1-tran And the abacus only a toy And we did our computing in primordial darkness When I was a boy When I was a boy
