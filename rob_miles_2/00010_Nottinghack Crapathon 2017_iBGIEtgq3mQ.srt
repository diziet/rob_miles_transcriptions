1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,900
So today is the Crap-A-Thon at Nottingham Hackspace, and I wasn't going to take part but then I had a stupid idea, so I'm going to, but, yeah, the idea of a Crap-A-Thon is you've got to build something, it's like a Hack-A-Thon, where you've got to build something quickly for a competition, but the thing you build has to be crappy, it has to be a terrible idea, something useless, something nobody would ever want,

2
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:53,800
or a good idea done really, really badly. Last year I made a robot that deliberately blinds people with a laser, which was fun. This year I'm going, you know, virtual reality is very big, so I'm going to try and make a VR app. My first one, never tried it before, so we'll see what happens.

3
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:08,700
So things are already underway, everybody's building their different things. This is Mouse, who you may know from Fire Pong, right? They had that computer file video. Anyway, what are you making?

4
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,600
I don't really know yet, I think it's going to be a greeter of some kind.

5
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,600
So the kids come along. What are you building, Daniel?

6
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,600
It's a box to identify whatever you put in there.

7
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,600
Oh, okay.

8
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,600
You put it in the camera, take a photo of it, and try to figure out what it is.

9
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,600
Huh, cool.

10
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,600
How the hell?

11
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,600
AI.

12
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,600
Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,500
You've got real AI happening. What are you building?

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,500
A temperature replicator.

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,500
Temperature replicator.

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,500
It's going to be a temperature sensor. There's a healthy effect module in there, so it can heat up cooking. This metal plate gets the same temperature sensor.

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,500
Oh.

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,500
It's going to identify your temperatures.

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,400
Quality.

20
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,400
Over here, we have Michael Erskine, who made... You were on Computerphile, weren't you? You were on the first one.

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,400
Yes.

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,400
Making that arcade machine.

23
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,400
Anyway, what's this going to be?

24
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,400
This is a privacy booth for people to browse pictures of pegs on the internet.

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,400
Peg fetishists.

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,400
Oh, yeah. I'll blur those.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,300
There's three types of pegs. There's clothes pegs, tent pegs, and stunt pegs for BMXs.

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,300
Oh, yeah, right.

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,300
I'm going to have three modes for the web app.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,300
That makes sense.

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,300
And the appropriate privacy.

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,300
Because people don't want people looking at them while they're looking at pegs.

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,300
So it's going to be installed in the library.

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,300
Oh, what, in that library?

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,300
No, in the public library.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,300
Oh, the public library. Okay. Perfect.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,300
Thanks.

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,300
So James Fouts is building...

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,300
What's he building in there?

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,300
A butt.

41
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,300
Oh, my God. It's so pink. Why does it have a nipple?

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,300
It's a pimple.

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,300
It's a butt activation mechanism button.

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,200
Oh, the butt button. Okay.

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm rendered speechless.

46
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,200
We were not expecting that.

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,200
Thank you.

48
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,200
Ready?

49
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,200
Okay, do it.

50
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,200
I've got to do it.

51
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,200
Do it. Do it.

52
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,200
Oh, Jesus.

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,200
Pull it. Get it out. Get it out.

54
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm full of blood.

55
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,200
What even is that?

56
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,200
It's so strange feeling.

57
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,200
Ew.

58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,200
This feels weird.

59
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,200
Yeah.

60
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,200
Okay, that's enough.

61
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,200
That's it? That'll do?

62
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah. More fingers.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,100
Oh, more fingers.

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,100
There's more of them.

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,100
All right.

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,100
They're going to be able to bend easy.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,100
What a well-organized crap-a-thon.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,100
Isn't it?

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,100
Okay.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,100
Finally managed to get the first glove all wired up.

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,100
Cardboard prototyping.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,100
Yeah.

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,100
Something like that.

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,100
Except made out of black plastic, hopefully.

75
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,100
There's your prototype.

76
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,100
Cardboard version.

77
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm going to try and capture that in selfie mode.

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,000
Am I in shot?

79
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,000
Maybe. Could be.

80
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,000
Cyber. Space.

81
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,000
Here I come.

82
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,000
We've got ask components here.

83
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,000
That's great.

84
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,000
This looks like a toaster and a vacuum cleaner.

85
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,000
Not even going to ask.

86
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey.

87
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, this is the box that you put things in and it tells you what's in the box.

88
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,000
It's usually wrong.

89
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, I mean, it's a crap-a-thon.

90
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,000
The booth coming along well.

91
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a high activity here.

92
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,000
So I've got my gloves.

93
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,000
The fingertip sensors.

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:17,000
The bending sensors on each finger.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,900
So this is prototype identifying machine.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,900
It says it's ready.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,900
Focus.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,900
Invertebrate.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,900
It's an invertebrate.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,900
Technically true. It has no spine.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,900
Okay.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,900
It's getting worse.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,900
It is getting worse.

104
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,800
The camera's gone.

105
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,800
It's taking longer.

106
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,800
Dual cell battery. 12 x AAA.

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,800
That's quite impressive.

108
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,800
I'm impressed.

109
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay, it can do batteries.

110
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,800
Maybe it can identify spray paint.

111
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,800
Is it gloss white spray paint?

112
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,800
Steady, steady.

113
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,800
You hold it and I'll press.

114
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,800
Oh, okay.

115
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,700
Work of gloss spray paint, antique white, 400 millilitres.

116
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,700
400 millilitres?

117
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,700
Hang on, where's the...

118
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,700
It is!

119
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,700
Good job.

120
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,700
I'm never going to use that.

121
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,700
Oh, all right.

122
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,700
Spray paint the base of this.

123
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,700
Crunch time now. Everybody's serious.

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,700
Okay, so now I'm cutting material based on my template that I took apart.

125
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,700
So, pretty much guaranteed to take off one of my fingers.

126
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,700
My own shot.

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,700
Laboratory's for sure.

128
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,700
Virtual hack space.

129
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,700
It has a logo on it now, which is nice.

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,700
I've got the wiring all up so I've got my laptop in the backpack.

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,700
I know, I'm making an announcement.

132
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,700
And all the cables there so you can connect it up.

133
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,600
People of hack space, your attention please.

134
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,600
People of hack space, your attention please.

135
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,600
If you have not registered your project, please do so now.

136
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,600
Thank you.

137
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,600
Anyway, what are you doing?

138
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,600
Playing golf.

139
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:35,600
Oh, so this is the prize, is it?

140
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:45,600
One minute remaining. Would all competitors please take a voting form. Thank you.

141
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:54,600
This is so organized.

142
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,600
Who's going to get my vote?

143
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,500
Thank you everybody for attending Crap-a-thon 2017.

144
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,500
We now come to the presentations of the Crap-a-thon projects with the lovely Froggy.

145
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,500
I need a volunteer.

146
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,500
Froggy's a volunteer.

147
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,500
You can demonstrate to about 9,000.

148
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,500
Follow the instructions and read them out. It's a multi-user experience.

149
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:30,400
Instructions. Increase power by rotating dial on power supply.

150
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,400
I go faster, the more power you have.

151
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,400
Oh shit, it's actually jammed up.

152
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,400
Wait for it, wait for it.

153
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,400
Shall I turn it back on?

154
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,400
It does get a little bit jammed up.

155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,400
Currently, I'm all loaded up with notes about the space.

156
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,300
Plug me into a USP power pack and walk around.

157
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,300
Welcome to Nottinghack.

158
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,300
And then you start the Nottinghack symbol.

159
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,300
I am Torbot 9000.

160
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,300
I will show you around.

161
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,300
You can walk around with it. Take that. And then take that as well.

162
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,200
It's portable.

163
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,200
How's the membership tour guide notes on it?

164
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,200
Well.

165
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,200
Michael Erskine, please present your project.

166
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:40,200
So this is a booth so that people can browse the internet in peace.

167
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:47,200
It presents images of pegs.

168
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,100
You can take a seat.

169
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,100
Each visitor is limited to an hour.

170
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,100
And it's your responsibility to wipe down the walls.

171
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,100
And a flame proof version is coming in 2018.

172
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,100
Thank you.

173
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,000
The next competitor is Maxim and Denis. When do you wake up?

174
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,000
When you wake up, you set an alarm.

175
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,000
And you are very tempted to just postpone it, postpone it again.

176
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,000
Do it every time.

177
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,000
So we have a solution.

178
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,000
You put your phone into our device.

179
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,000
And it has a light sensor.

180
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,000
Unless you wake up, go and switch on the light.

181
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,000
You see what happens. You try to reach your phone.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,900
Yeah, and when it's dark.

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,900
After this, you are definitely going to wake up.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,900
Thank you very much.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,900
Number five is James with Choco Butt.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,900
Right, this is going to take a lot of explaining, so I'm kind of sensitive.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,900
It's a butt that poops chocolate.

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,900
That's what it is.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,900
It's for Halloween.

190
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,800
So it's basically for when you hate kids, but you don't mind kids enjoying themselves.

191
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,800
You just don't want to be there when it happens.

192
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,800
So you can leave it outside your house.

193
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,800
And the kid comes up and presses a button.

194
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,800
And it poops the chocolate butt.

195
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,800
You need someone who wants to be the kid.

196
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,800
Right. God, I hope this works.

197
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,800
I'm not sure how I do it.

198
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,800
So we load the chocolate.

199
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,700
And then very carefully press the button.

200
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,700
If you press too hard, it breaks.

201
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,700
There we go.

202
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,700
And then it turns and the chocolate...

203
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,700
...falls out of the hole.

204
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Choco Butt.

205
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,700
Next up we have the lovely mouse with, I don't know what I'm doing, the third.

206
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,600
Third year of Capcom, third year I don't know what I'm doing.

207
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Okay, so continuing the Halloween theme.

208
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,600
And I know you never thought I would say this, James, but remarkably similar to your project in some ways...

209
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,600
...is the auto-insulter.

210
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,600
So the idea for this is you leave it unattended.

211
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,600
And when annoying children come to your door, you don't have to be there to slam the door in their face.

212
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,600
It will do it for you.

213
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,600
Except the sound doesn't work, so I'm going to have to simulate the sound.

214
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,600
Someone will just walk in front of it.

215
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,500
So basically, it should be making sound, but that doesn't work yet.

216
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,500
Bugger off!

217
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,500
And then when the next kid comes along...

218
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,500
Shut up! Get out of here!

219
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,500
The next one, I'm so glad this one made it, is...

220
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,400
...is What's in the Box by Toby, James and Daniel.

221
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,400
Different James.

222
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,400
Okay, so...

223
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,400
Often, when in the hat space...

224
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,400
...you pick up an item and not know what that item is.

225
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,400
So this is a box that you can put that item in, press the button...

226
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,400
...and it will try and tell you what is in the box.

227
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,300
I think one of the best ones was this, Rosette.

228
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,300
Try that.

229
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,300
Come on.

230
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,300
You can do it.

231
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,300
Thank you.

232
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,300
Is there any chance that we can put someone else's project in the What's in the Box?

233
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,300
If someone else's project is small enough to fit in the What's in the Box box...

234
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,300
...I'm more than happy to...

235
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,300
I might have to present it.

236
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,300
Well...

237
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,300
Next up, we have Hazel with the Cyber Hat.

238
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,300
Next up, this is scaring me quite a bit, we have Andrew with his Hover Toaster.

239
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,300
This is my vision of the future.

240
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,300
And it never really came about, so I really had to build it.

241
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,300
And I bring you Hover Toaster.

242
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,300
What the fuck?

243
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,300
I'll test the toasting function.

244
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:16,300
The intermittent operation is due to the interlock, which is...

245
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,300
And you can smell the delicious toast, can't you?

246
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,300
How long is the toast to toast?

247
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,300
I'm not going to have to make it hot!

248
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,300
You've got to hit the cancel button.

249
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,300
Yay!

250
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,200
Good job.

251
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,200
Up next is Virtual Hackspace.

252
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,200
Oh, that's me. Can somebody else film me?

253
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,200
You can't always be at the Hackspace.

254
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,200
Sometimes, some people can't easily get to a Hackspace.

255
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,100
Sometimes, you're at home, and you want that Hackspace experience.

256
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:39,100
I've spent some time putting together this simulation of a Hackspace, so you can have that experience.

257
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,100
First off, we have gloves, which have sensors in them and some feedback.

258
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,100
Plug in the gloves.

259
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,100
Okay.

260
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,100
And now, I'll put the Virtual Hackspace headset on.

261
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,100
All lined up.

262
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,100
Yeah, no, I haven't turned it on yet.

263
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:22,100
Let me just turn it on. You should see an exact one-to-one simulation of a Hackspace.

264
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,100
Sorry.

265
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,100
Next up, we have the lovely Ian.

266
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,100
This is icy water, so we'll put that in there.

267
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,100
This starts to cool down. We need to get some ice forming on here earlier.

268
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,100
Does anyone want to feel that?

269
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,100
So I'm not making things up?

270
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,100
Keep your fingers on it.

271
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,000
It's going to happen now.

272
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,000
Is it getting warm yet?

273
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,000
It's still cold at the moment. The temperature is slowly rising.

274
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,000
You see a laptop screen. It's got two temperatures on it.

275
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,000
That's now no longer cold.

276
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,000
Is that getting hot?

277
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,000
It's acceptably warm right now.

278
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,000
Now that's unpleasantly warm, and it's too hot to touch now.

279
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,000
That's my temperature replicator.

280
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,000
Craftsman badge, Emmanuel.

281
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,000
I made a nice, cool Craftsman badge.

282
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, that's it. That's my Craftsman badge.

283
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
That's the spirit of the festival.

284
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,000
Everybody who's entered the competition, please get your voting forms back to me ASAP.

285
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,900
Hackers Assemble, for the results of the 2017 Craftathon Contest.

286
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,900
In joint third place, James with Chocobot.

287
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,900
And Rob Miles with Virtual Hackspace.

288
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,900
In second place, What's in the Box?

289
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,800
We have Toby, Daniel and the other James.

290
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm so pleased to report that in first place, with an absolute landslide victory, is Andrew with Hover Toaster.

291
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:37,700
Congratulations to the Craftathon 2017.

292
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:44,700
Toby and a very special prize of a really crap solar-powered light.

293
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,700
Congratulations.

294
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,700
You deserve it.

295
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,600
It's me!

296
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,600
Well, since joining me in Hackspace last year, this has been my dream.

297
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,600
You fabulous, fabulous people have made it possible. Thank you very much.

298
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,600
I now propose a toast.

299
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,600
We'll change our mind about that.

300
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,600
Actually, I didn't get a really good shot of it from the butt side.

301
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,600
Oh yeah, that's a quality crack.

302
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,600
Watching his ass being destroyed.
