1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Imagine, the year is 1983 and you are a Soviet military officer.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,240
1983 is a very dangerous time to be, well, on Earth.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,640
The Cold War is not feeling very cold.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,120
Tensions between the United States and the USSR are extremely high.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,160
The messages from politicians and the media sound like,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,840
a nuclear war would be terrible.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
We need to avoid it at all costs.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,560
But the Americans seem like they almost want it to happen.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,280
We need to make it seem like we're willing to do it too,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,400
just to keep those crazy capitalist bastards from trying anything.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,200
And both sides are quite successful in convincing the other

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,480
that they're willing to push the button.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,400
Maybe too successful.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,960
NATO has deployed nuclear missiles in Western Europe

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,680
that can hit Soviet targets within 10 minutes.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600
And the USA is running what it calls psychological operations,

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,720
which involves flying large fleets of aircraft almost into Soviet airspace

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,640
and then turning back at the last minute,

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,960
with the goal of provoking a Soviet response

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,400
so that they can gather intelligence about how the early warning systems work,

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,680
what the protocols are,

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,160
how the Soviets will respond to various scenarios.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,520
In April, the most powerful naval fleet ever assembled

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,280
converges in the North Pacific,

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
again trying to provoke the USSR into reacting

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,160
to learn more about their defences.

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,920
Then, on September the 1st,

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,880
a South Korean airliner flies over prohibited Soviet airspace and is shot down.

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
The American president, Ronald Reagan, appears on television

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
calling it a massacre and a crime against humanity that must not be forgotten.

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,320
The media on both sides portray the other side as the aggressor,

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
as itching to start a nuclear war.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,160
The relationship between the USA and the USSR is well known to you.

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,280
It's a big part of your job.

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
You are in charge of a secure military facility near Moscow,

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,240
a facility that's tasked with managing a new state-of-the-art system of satellites

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
orbiting the Earth 24 hours a day,

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
looking for the telltale infrared signature of a nuclear missile launch.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,840
It's the 26th of September, around midnight.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,760
Your job is important, but it's also very boring.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,120
Suddenly, all of the computers jump to life.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,360
They've detected a missile launch from the United States.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Sirens, flashing lights, everybody's out of their seats.

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
The word START flashing on the screen in big red letters.

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,000
You're the commanding officer,

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,960
so you tell everyone to get to their positions and await your orders.

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,320
What are your orders?

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,160
Well, you know the protocol.

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,280
You help write it.

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,240
Your job as the commanding officer in this facility is,

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,080
in the event of a launch detection,

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
to verify that the report is accurate,

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,840
and then pass it on up the chain of command.

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
So you do your job.

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,520
First, you make sure that the computer's working properly.

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,320
You have the technicians run through a set of test procedures

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,800
designed to verify that the system isn't malfunctioning.

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,960
Secondly, there's also a backup system,

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,240
which involves human beings sitting in front of monitors

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,000
and looking at images from these satellites.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
So you ask them to confirm the launch.

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,360
They come back and say,

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,320
we don't know.

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,000
The sun is setting over the USA.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Half the image is bright, half is dark,

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,760
and the place the launch is meant to have happened

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
is right on the Terminator between night and day.

68
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
It's very difficult for us to see.

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,120
We can't see the missile, but if it was there,

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
we probably wouldn't be able to see it either.

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,960
We can't confirm or deny.

72
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,640
Then the computer room gets back to you.

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
They say there's no malfunction in the system.

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,120
Everything is working as it should be.

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
All of the tests on 30 levels have passed.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,960
The system's alerts come with an associated confidence rating,

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,760
and this report has confidence level maximum.

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,960
The computer operators tell you this is a legitimate detection.

79
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,240
Your job is now unambiguous.

80
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,600
The protocol is clear.

81
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,280
The system has confirmed a launch.

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
Now your job is to report that up the chain.

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
What do you do?

84
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,720
This is all the information you have.

85
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,920
You have the computer system.

86
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
It's telling you there's a launch with maximum confidence.

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,680
You have the visual units who are telling you that they don't know.

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
There's no way to get any additional information.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,840
The next thing you can know about it will be

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,360
when Soviet ground-based radar stations pick up the incoming missiles,

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,600
which would be just a couple of minutes before impact,

92
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,280
much too late to do anything about it.

93
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,240
The clock is ticking.

94
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,040
What do you do?

95
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,680
You know that because of the heightened state of alert

96
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
that the system is at right now,

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,440
the Soviet policy is launch on warning.

98
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,640
This means that the USSR will launch a retaliatory strike

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
without first waiting for missiles to actually hit.

100
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,840
By the time nuclear missiles are striking their targets,

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
they'll be destroying infrastructure,

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
destroying your communication systems,

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,960
destroying your ability to coordinate a retaliatory strike.

104
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,320
If you don't react decisively and immediately, you don't react.

105
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,960
So the system is set up to retaliate as soon as a missile launches are detected.

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,720
Mutual knowledge of this fact is the only known defense we've got.

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,000
So you know that if you call in a verified missile launch,

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,280
it will almost certainly start a global thermonuclear war.

109
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,960
What do you do?

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
You don't have much time to think.

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
And while you're doing it, the system registers another launch.

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
A second missile is detected.

113
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,280
Again, with maximum confidence.

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,160
And again, the visual units can't confirm or deny.

115
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,120
Before you can decide what to do, another missile appears.

116
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
And another, and another.

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,640
Five missiles show on your screen.

118
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,240
What do you do?

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,560
This is, of course, a true story.

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
And the man in this scenario was Stanislav Petrov.

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,760
And what Petrov does is he stops and thinks.

122
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,640
He thinks something like, it could be a mistake.

123
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,160
But this satellite system is extremely sophisticated and carefully designed and tested.

124
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
So a malfunction is very unlikely.

125
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,480
On the other hand, I don't think the USA really wants a nuclear war.

126
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,760
They might launch a preemptive nuclear strike against us, but that seems unlikely.

127
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,360
And if they did want to attack first, wouldn't they throw everything at us?

128
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,560
An attack that only uses five missiles is possible, but again, unlikely.

129
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
He weighs up the probabilities.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,720
He picks up the phone and, contrary to protocol, he calls it in as a system error.

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,160
False alarm.

132
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,960
There are no missiles, he says, staring at the five missiles on his screen.

133
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,600
And in the facility, they wait.

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
They don't have to wait long.

135
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,880
ICBMs are fast.

136
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
They wait to hear the radar stations detecting these incoming missiles.

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,240
And a few minutes later, when the time comes, the radar stations detect nothing.

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,480
It was a false alarm.

139
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,960
It would later be discovered that the satellite system was confused by sunlight reflecting off

140
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,480
high-altitude clouds.

141
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,280
By using his head, by thinking, by not following the protocol, Stanislav Petrov single-handedly

142
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,320
prevented hundreds of millions of human deaths.

143
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,080
The destruction of all of civilization, effectively the end of the world.

144
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,120
Some of you probably will have heard of him.

145
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
Some of you probably will not have.

146
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,480
Because this whole incident was somewhat embarrassing for the Soviet Union.

147
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,400
It was embarrassing that their satellite system had failed.

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,280
It was embarrassing that all of their sophisticated engineering had to be saved by one individual

149
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,160
person's judgment.

150
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
And it was probably embarrassing that one of their military officers deliberately went

151
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
against protocol.

152
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,200
Anyway, Petrov could not be rewarded without his superiors being punished.

153
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,360
So Petrov was not rewarded.

154
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Instead, they told him off for not filling out his paperwork about the incident properly.

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
And the whole thing had to be kept secret for 10 years.

156
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,520
He couldn't even tell his wife what happened before she died.

157
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,280
And he retired to live alone on his pension, unsung, until relatively recently.

158
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,920
Stanislav Petrov died this year, aged 77.

159
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
He actually died back in May.

160
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,400
And we didn't learn about it until this month, because nobody's really keeping in touch.

161
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,120
There may come a day when people who sing or act or play sports aren't as famous as

162
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,080
people who literally save the entire goddamn world.

163
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,960
There may come a day when people who win wars are not as respected as people who prevent

164
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,760
wars.

165
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,800
That day is not today.

166
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,200
But maybe we can work towards it.

167
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,360
Petrov rejected the idea that he was a hero.

168
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,320
But I disagree.

169
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,000
I think he's a hero to everyone who values thinking for yourself.

170
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,200
Not buying into the hype.

171
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,160
Not being distracted by the noise, the media.

172
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Anyone who values trying to see things as they really are.

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,320
I think he's a hero for everyone who values trying to actually do your job to the best

174
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,400
of your ability, rather than blindly following the procedures you've been given.

175
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,480
And I think he's a hero to anyone who values not destroying the world.

176
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
Which I think is something we can all get behind.

177
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,640
So today, September 26th, the anniversary of his momentous decision, I'll be celebrating

178
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Petrov Day.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The traditional way to celebrate Petrov Day is to not destroy the world.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
And I hope you'll all join me in that.

181
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,560
And this Petrov Day is an unusual and historic and sad one.

182
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
The first Petrov Day with no Petrov in the world he helped to save.

183
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,240
So let's try to learn from him.

184
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,920
Let's try to create a world with more people like him.

185
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
Let's try to survive this century.

186
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,080
Because we still have vast arsenals of nuclear weapons on a hair trigger for some stupid

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,720
fucking reason.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,520
And that might not even be the worst of it.
